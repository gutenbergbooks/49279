How to Get, and How to Keep It</p>

<h2 id="INTRODUCTION" class="nobreak mt">INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>The injunction “Know thyself” was inscribed in
letters of gold over the portico of the temple of
Delphi. We can know ourselves only by thoughtful
observation and reflection. General forms of exercise
may be presented, but we must consider whether
our present health and physical condition will not
require some modification of the prescribed forms.
Certain modes of bathing and specific rules for diet
and sleep may be good for the multitude and yet
unsuited to particular individuals. Any marked
change from our accustomed manner of life should
begin gradually. For one who, in winter, has never
taken any other than a warm or tepid bath, to plunge
suddenly and without preparation into a tub of cold
water might be attended with serious results, while
by gradual stages the same point may be reached
with positive advantage to health and comfort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>The popular error still prevails that a well
equipped gymnasium and costly apparatus are necessary
to healthful physical development. It is an important
part of the object of this work to show that
with little or no outlay for apparatus, and with the
expenditure of very little time, both health and vigor
may be secured and preserved, and the success and
happiness of life be greatly promoted.</p>

<p>The hindrances to a more general adoption of a
course of physical training as a means of promoting
health and strength are:</p>

<p>1. Ignorance of the advantages to be secured.</p>

<p>2. Distrust of the efficiency of the methods.</p>

<p>3. Mistaken notions concerning cost of appliances.</p>

<p>4. The fear that too much time will be required
to make the exercise profitable.</p>

<p>5. The belief that the old way is the best&mdash;to
take your chances while you are well, and send for
the doctor when you are ill.</p>

<p>The long lists of clergymen, comparatively young
in years, but broken down in health, their usefulness
gone, and themselves a burden upon the community,
have taught the aspiring candidate for the ministry
a useful lesson. The pulpit of to-day includes some
of the most prominent college athletes, and all professional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
men acknowledge the benefits to be derived
from physical training.</p>

<p>Who can fully estimate the value of health? It affects
not only the happiness, but also the usefulness
of every life. Without it, no substantial success can
be achieved. By due attention to the simple laws
of health, involving fresh air, pure water, wholesome
food, sensible clothing, proper exercise, rest, and
sleep, nine-tenths of all the ailments that afflict mankind,
and the largest amount of human misery resulting
therefrom, would be prevented.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter"> </div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="AIR">AIR</h2>


<p><b>Essentials of Life.</b>&mdash;Air, water, and food are
the great essentials of life. A man may go for days
without food, and for hours without water, but
deprive him of air, even for a few minutes, and he
ceases to live. In quantity, the daily consumption
of air far outmeasures the other two; in purity, it
receives the least consideration. The city and the
State alike exercise some oversight of the food and
water supply of the people. Impurities in these
often appeal to the sense of sight or smell or taste,
and the individual is put on his guard. The intangible
air is laden with the foulest and most poisonous
substances, and is as freely inhaled as if it could
make no difference to the health.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Lung Capacity.</b>&mdash;The quantity of the air we
breathe is also important. We may eat too much
food, even though it be absolutely pure and wholesome,
but we cannot consume too much pure air.
The larger the lung space, therefore, the better for
health and strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>The full lung capacity of the average adult is
about 330 cubic inches, but an ordinary inspiration
does not take in more than one-eleventh part of that
volume. The value of full, deep breathing, and of
large lung capacity becomes at once apparent. The
larger the quantity of air consumed, the greater the
amount of life-giving oxygen conveyed through the
blood to all parts of the body. No form of physical
exercise, therefore, can exceed in value the breathing
exercises described in another chapter.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Rate of Breathing.</b>&mdash;It is estimated that we
breathe once during every four beats of the heart,
or about eighteen times a minute. The relation between
the heart and lungs is so close that whatever
modifies the pulse affects the breathing. When the
heart action is hurried, more blood is sent to the
lungs, requiring more rapid action on their part.
About every fifth breath the inspiration is longer and
fuller, the effect being to change more completely
the air of the lungs.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Holding the Breath.</b>&mdash;While respiration is, for
the most part, involuntary, we may arrest the breathing
for the space of twenty to thirty seconds. If
we first fortify the lungs by taking several deep
inspirations and expelling the impure air as fully as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
possible, we may hold the breath for a minute or
two. This power will prove of advantage if we
have occasion to pass through a room or hallway
filled with smoke, or to remain under water for a
brief time. The pearl-fishers, as a result of training,
remain under water from three to four minutes.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Importance of Pure Air.</b>&mdash;Pure air means pure
blood. The air of the mountain tops or by the sea
fills us with life, while that of narrow streets, crowded
rooms, unventilated dwellings, schools, churches,
and theatres is depressing, weakening, and death-dealing.</p>

<p>So far from the aristocracy having a monopoly of
blue blood, it flows through the veins of high and
low alike. It goes out from the lungs bright and
rich with oxygen; it comes back to the heart dark
with the waste and poisonous matters which it has
gathered in its course.</p>

<p>Atmospheric air is composed of several gases, the
principal elements being oxygen, nitrogen, and watery
vapor. All animal life requires oxygen for the
combustion of the material supplied through the
blood. The blood makes its circuit through the
body three times a minute. It comes to the lungs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
laden with poisonous matter. Nearly one-third of
the excretions of the body are eliminated through
the lungs. The average adult contaminates about
five thousand cubic inches of air with every breath.
The importance of having an abundant supply of
pure air at all times is obvious.</p>

<p>In ordinary respiration an adult abstracts sixteen
cubic feet of oxygen from the atmosphere every
twenty-four hours, and adds to it fourteen cubic feet
of carbonic acid in the same time. If the individual
were confined in a close apartment, in which the air
could not mingle with the atmosphere without, the
processes of life could not long be maintained.</p>

<p>History furnishes many instances of the direful
effects of crowding a number of human beings into
a limited space without ventilation. One hundred
and fifty passengers were confined in the small cabin
of a steamship one stormy night, and when morning
came only eighty were found alive. Three hundred
prisoners, after the battle of Austerlitz, were crowded
into a close prison, and within a few hours two
hundred and sixty of them had died.</p>

<p>The effects of foul air are not usually so sudden
nor so striking. More frequently they consist of a
general deficiency of nutrition, loss of vigor of
body and mind, and of the power of resistance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
disease. Consumptive patients, in a large majority
of cases, come from the classes whose occupations
confine them to ill-ventilated rooms. A cramped
position of the body while at work, and want of good
wholesome food, contribute to the mortality from
this cause.</p>

<p>Absolutely pure air is rarely found in nature.
Even in the open country there are three parts of
carbonic acid in ten thousand parts of air. In cities
and towns, the out-door air contains from four to
five parts of carbonic acid. When, in dwellings and
churches and halls, it reaches six to seven parts, its
impurity is detected by the nose, the lungs suffer
from a lack of oxygen, and the room feels close and
stuffy.</p>

<p>The amount of carbonic acid in the breath is
about five per cent. Air once used is therefore unfit
for purposes of animal combustion. If breathed
into a jar containing a short lighted candle, it will
at once extinguish the flame. It would also prove
fatal to small birds or mice. When the carbonic
acid reaches one part in ten of common air, it becomes
fatal to man.</p>

<p>Headaches, dullness, drowsiness, and labored respiration
are the first symptoms of this lung poison.
Faintness, convulsions, and unconsciousness are a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
later stage. School-houses, churches, theatres, and
factories should be so well ventilated that the proportion
of carbonic acid would not exceed two parts
in one thousand.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Effects of Breathing Impure Air.</b>&mdash;Air which
is only slightly vitiated, if breathed day after day,
for a considerable time, produces most serious results.
Its effects are seen in pale faces, loss of appetite,
depressed spirits, and a lack of muscular
vigor.</p>

<p>An investigation made some years ago showed
86 deaths per 1,000 in a badly ventilated prison, and
of these, 51.4 per 1,000 were due to phthisis, or
consumption. In the House of Correction, in the
same city, which was well ventilated, the death rate
was 14 per 1,000, and of these only 7.9 were occasioned
by phthisis. The organic particles thrown
off from the lungs of diseased persons are responsible
for the prevalence of phthisis and other lung diseases.
It is also a well established fact that a bad
atmosphere promotes the rapid spread of such specific
diseases as small-pox, typhus, and scarlet fever.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Constant Supply.</b>&mdash;Of so great importance is
the matter of having a constant supply of unvitiated
air that sanitariums for consumptives are now be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>coming
common in which the principal feature is to
have the patients enjoy a continuous out-door existence,
day and night, being wrapped up and otherwise
protected from cold and dampness. Consumptive
symptoms often yield to this treatment.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Individual Habit.</b>&mdash;Habit has much to do with
our appreciation of pure air. If we recognize its
value to health and to all the mental and physical
activities, and insist upon a plentiful supply of pure
oxygen, the habit soon becomes a second nature, and
we instinctively feel uncomfortable upon entering an
ill-ventilated room. In northern climates, economic
considerations often interfere with the highest sanitary
regulations. Householders, school boards, and
church trustees frequently save fuel at the expense
of health.</p>

<p>We may, however, by spending much time in
poorly ventilated rooms, become so accustomed to
the depressing influence of the impoverished atmosphere
that we suffer a sort of semi-stupor without
being conscious of the fact. How great a wrong is
inflicted upon children in the school-room and in the
crowded factory, by subjecting them, day after day,
for months and years, to a vitiated atmosphere,
laden with the poisonous exhalations from lungs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and skin! Their growing bodies are stunted and
their awakening intellects dulled, and the seeds of
disease and weakness are implanted to develop into
a harvest of wretchedness and misery in later life.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Sea Air.</b>&mdash;When the breeze is off the ocean,
the air is practically free from the exhalations of
animals, the smoke and soot of chimneys, and the
gases of sewers. The curative value of sea-air is
well known. It comes richly laden with ozone, and
its effect upon sojourners at the sea-side is very
stimulating. Many persons are not strong enough
to endure sea-bathing, yet gain much benefit from
the sea-air.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Mountain Air.</b>&mdash;The air of the mountains is
pure. It is usually still, and seldom foggy. Being
more rarefied than that of the low-lying valleys, it
contains less oxygen in proportion to volume, but
its lesser density gives to the oxygen greater activity.</p>

<p>The body loses heat less rapidly in rarefied atmospheres,
so that there is probably less need of heat-production
on the mountain than on the plain, combustion
being less active. The rapid and great
variations of temperature of the mountain regions
stimulate the vital processes and contribute to the
curative agencies of those altitudes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Night Air.</b>&mdash;There is a prevailing prejudice
against night air. By many persons out-door air is
shut out of the sleeping room as if it were pestilential.
Analysis as well as experience shows that
the most vitiated and unwholesome night air is that
which has been breathed over and over again in a
close sleeping apartment. Admit the outside air
freely if you desire health. Guard against draughts,
and use just enough bed covering for comfort.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Air of the School-Room.</b>&mdash;A plentiful supply
of pure air is desirable wherever there are people
to breathe it. In no place is it more important than
in the school-room. Confined for six hours each
day during the period of life when the best health
conditions are required for the proper growth of
mind and body, the child thus robbed of the needed
oxygen is wronged. The adult who voluntarily subjects
himself once or twice a week for two hours to
the poisonous atmosphere of church, lecture hall, or
theatre, may experience a temporary headache, but
is soon revived after reaching the fresh air. The
child, ignorant of the wrong he is made to suffer,
and incapable of providing better conditions,
breathes the poisonous exhalations from fifty pairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of lungs, day after day, and thus has sown in his
system the seeds of disease.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Illuminating Gas.</b>&mdash;Many persons die every
year by inhaling illuminating gas. People unacquainted
with the use of gas fixtures often blow out
the light instead of turning the key. A prevailing
custom in some families is to keep the light burning
low during the night. A variation of pressure in the
pipes, or a sudden draught of air, extinguishes the
slender flame, and gas escapes into the room, often
with fatal results.</p>

<p>Leaky pipes or faulty fixtures may have the same
effect. If the key be loose, tighten the screw that
holds it in place. If there is a leak in the pipe or
joint, which may be determined by applying a match,
a gas-fitter should at once be summoned. Delay is
dangerous and may prove fatal.</p>

<p>If a room be heavily charged with gas, get the
windows and doors open as soon as possible. Do
not go near with a light, lest an explosion follow.
Naphtha and benzine are also highly explosive.
When either is used to clean clothing, the work
should be done in the open air, and never where the
fumes may come in contact with the fire of stove or
range, or with the flame of candle or lamp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Gas burners, oil lamps, sperm candles, all forms of
illuminants, consume the oxygen of a room and increase
the carbonic acid. An oil lamp of ordinary
dimensions gives off as much carbonic acid as an
adult person. A man, seated in a room of moderate
dimensions and using a good oil lamp, will require
6,000 cubic feet of fresh air every hour in order to
keep the air from becoming vitiated beyond the
point of wholesomeness. Gas from coal, coke, or
charcoal fires is as dangerous as illuminating gas.</p>

<p>Heaters, ranges, stoves, and furnaces should be
kept in complete order, so that no gas shall escape.
Its entrance into a bedroom is often so stealthy as to
stupefy the unconscious sleeper and destroy life
without awakening him.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Sewer Gas.</b>&mdash;Of all forms of vitiated air in
cities, none is responsible for such serious derangement
of health as that which is polluted by the air
or gas from sewers and waste pipes. Some physicians
and sanitarians hold that sewer air is often the
direct cause of typhoid fever, scarlet fever, diphtheria,
and cholera. Others maintain that the sewers
and pipes furnish favorable breeding places for
the germs of these diseases, which germs are carried
through the air and produce their effects. The important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
matter is to keep the waste pipes flushed and
well trapped. Some precautions against sewer gas
are treated in the chapter on Dwellings.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Influence of Climate and Temperature.</b>&mdash;Diarrhœal
diseases, both of adults and children, are most
frequent during hot weather. In July, August, and
September there are from ten to twelve times as
many cases as at other seasons of the year. Proper
diet and suitable clothing will go far toward protecting
the individual from the ill effects of climate
and season.</p>

<p>The mortality from consumption and other forms
of lung diseases is greatest in March and April, and
least in August and September. September and
October claim the greatest number of deaths from
typhoid fever, followed closely by August and November.
The mortality from diphtheria and croup is
highest in November and December, and lowest in
August and September. Of suicides, the largest
number occur in May, and the fewest in February.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Hygienic Value of Winds.</b>&mdash;Prof. Dexter, of the
University of Illinois, has made a careful study of
the effects of calms on the records of the public
schools, the police courts, and the penitentiaries. All
air movements not exceeding four miles an hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
are regarded as calms. Over 497,000 observations
were considered and tabulated. These show that
during calm weather the absence from school on
account of illness is three times as great as that during
all other kinds of weather, including the very
cold, wet, and windy. During calms, the criminal
records show less disorder and violence, more policemen
are laid off, more errors are made by clerks in
banks, and more deaths are reported. This is in accordance
with the principle that oxygen is the great
source of mental and physical energy. When oxygen
is deficient, we are less capable of action, either for
good or evil. The slowly-moving air-currents of a
large city are robbed of their oxygen, and vitiated
by the exhalations of thousands of men and animals.
A brisk wind brings in a fresh supply of vitalized
air to take the place of the old, and to promote physical
and mental energy. Old Boreas is a better
friend than we have been wont to believe.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Nature’s Balance.</b>&mdash;By a wise provision of nature,
the carbonic acid, which is so destructive to all
animal life, constitutes the chief food of plants.
These absorb the carbon and give out oxygen, and
in this way the animal and vegetable kingdoms tend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
to preserve the balance of nature. Except for this
wonderful provision, the human family would be
threatened with annihilation.</p>

<h2 id="WATER">WATER</h2>


<p><b>Water in the Human Body.</b>&mdash;Taken as a whole,
the human body consists of about seventy-one parts
of water in the hundred. When we consider how
large a quantity of water is given off daily, not only
through the kidneys and intestines, but through
perspiration, sensible and insensible, and through
the vapor breathed out from the lungs, it becomes
clear that the food must contain a large proportion
of water to supply the daily loss.</p>

<p>The proportions of water are not always quite the
same, nor does the identical water present in any
part of the body at any given moment remain there.
There is a constant movement, a continual renewal
going on in the body, and water helps to accomplish
this renewal. By means of the watery substances, the
saliva, the bile, and other juices of the stomach and
intestines, the solid nutritive parts of the food are
dissolved, and pass into the blood to renew the waste,
and to keep up that continual current called life.
Water is also useful in carrying off the worn out and
useless materials which pass out through the fluid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
excretions and through the vapors from the lungs
and skin.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Water in Food.</b>&mdash;The amount of water contained
in many articles of food that appear quite
solid is generally surprising to those unacquainted
with the chemistry of foods. In one hundred pounds
by weight, fresh oatmeal contains 5 pounds of water.
Corn and barley meal, wheat flour, peas, and beans
contain 14 pounds; rice 15; bread 40; potatoes 75;
grapes 80; parsnips 81; beets 82; apples 83; carrots
and cabbages 89; onions 91; lettuce 96.</p>

<p>Of the animal foods, butter contains 10 pounds of
water in one hundred; bacon 22; cheese 34; eggs
72; lean meat 73; fish 74; milk 86. By cooking,
most foods lose a part of their natural moisture.
The eatable part of a mutton chop contains 70 per
cent of water before cooking, and 54 per cent after.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Daily Requirement.</b>&mdash;Scientific sanitarians have
estimated the daily requirement of water for a person
at from twelve to sixteen gallons. The British
War Department aims to provide each soldier
with fifteen gallons daily. In cities the daily allowance
per capita is fifty gallons and upwards, which
provides for animals, manufacturing purposes, fires,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
sewerage, etc., as well as for drinking, cooking, bathing,
and other wants of man.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Sources of Supply.</b>&mdash;The importance of an
abundant supply of pure water is becoming more
and more apparent each year. The numerous and
serious epidemics throughout the country whose
sources have been traced to the use of impure water
leave no room for question on this point. Most cities
draw their supplies from rivers and lakes. If these
sources are kept free from sewage and the waste of
manufacturing establishments the water is likely
to be pure and wholesome. Subsiding reservoirs
and filtration beds are needed to take out the mud
occasioned by rains, and to catch up whatever floating
matter may be carried into the basins. Muddiness
is not always an indication of unwholesomeness,
nor is clearness a proof of purity. Germs of disease
have been found in the clearest water. Whenever
there is the least suspicion of unwholesomeness, all
water used for cooking and drinking should be
boiled. It is not safe to trust to the theory, held by
some, that a running stream, even if polluted, will in
flowing a distance of twelve or fifteen miles purify
itself.</p>

<p>Wells, which are the chief source of supply in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
country, should be kept away from barnyards,
stables, cesspools, and the waste waters from dairy
and kitchen, to preserve them from pollution. Many
cases of typhoid fever and other serious diseases
have been directly traced to a violation of this rule.
The ground surrounding the well should be raised so
as to throw all surface water twelve or fifteen feet
away from the well. See also what is said on this
subject in the chapter on Dwellings.</p>

<p>Springs usually furnish the purest and best water.
Coming from a considerable depth, spring-water
loses, in its passage through the earth, most if not all
its organic matter, and rises to the surface clear,
cool, pure, and sparkling. The spring should be
walled and covered, and otherwise protected from
surface drainage.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Cisterns.</b>&mdash;Rain-water collected in the country,
and under favorable conditions, is comparatively
pure and wholesome. In the cities, it contains such
a large amount of organic matter and other impurities,
washed out of the air and off the roofs by the
rain and snow, that it is generally unfit for drinking
without being filtered. On account of its softness,
rain-water is very desirable for washing and other
domestic purposes, but owing to the absence of mineral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
constituents it is flat and insipid to the taste.
In New Orleans and other southern cities, where
cisterns are largely used, the water is rendered cool
and palatable by the use of large quantities of artificial
ice.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Ice.</b>&mdash;It was formerly supposed that in the process
of freezing all deleterious matter contained in
the water was excluded. Several outbreaks of disease
in New England led to an investigation, which
showed that the ice used had been taken from ponds
whose waters contained large quantities of sewage
and other impurities. A change in the source of the
ice supply resulted in an immediate check of the
disease. Recent research has shown that typhoid
bacilli, after being frozen in a block of ice for 103
days, may still be alive when released.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Diseases Caused by Drinking Polluted Water.</b>&mdash;A
polluted water supply affects not one, but
usually many persons, and notable epidemics have
resulted. In consequence, more diligent inquiry has
been instituted by Municipal, State, and National
Boards of Health, and the evidence adduced is of the
most positive character. Typhoid fever, cholera,
dysentery, and diarrhœa have been clearly traced
to the use of impure drinking water, and other related<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
diseases are suspected of having a similar
origin, although the evidence is not so conclusive.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Appearance.</b>&mdash;A drinking water should be clear
and bright. When shaken in a glass or bottle, bubbles
should rise quickly and break immediately. If
the bubbles move slowly, or seem to hang for some
time in the water, they are probably due to the presence
of decaying organic matter, and the water is of
questionable purity. A slight cloudiness in the appearance
of the water, following a rain, may be due
to the presence of a small quantity of earthy matter,
and not seriously affect its wholesomeness, but if the
discoloration looks like that occasioned by a drop
of milk the water should be avoided until carefully
tested.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Smell.</b>&mdash;A good water should have no smell.
To this end, the cisterns or other receptacles must
be kept perfectly clean. The purest and best waters
will soon become foul if stored in unclean vessels.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Taste.</b>&mdash;Water having a disagreeable taste is
apt to be unwholesome. In order that we may derive
from it proper nourishment, water, like other
parts of our food, should be pleasant to the taste.
And yet, the taste is by no means a satisfactory test
of purity. The purest of all water is distilled water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
which, by reason of the absence of all mineral matter
and air, has a flat and insipid taste. The cleanest
rain-water is also insipid. Boiled water is not
much better, for while the boiling process may have
destroyed all poisonous or noxious germs, and rendered
the water absolutely wholesome, it also drove
off the natural gases which gave to the water a
pleasant taste. Boiled water may be re-aerated by
pouring from an ordinary sprinkling can several
times.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Hard Water.</b>&mdash;Hardness is a serious drawback,
whether the water be used for cooking, bathing,
or for washing clothes. Food cooked by boiling
in hard water is, as a rule, not so well prepared.
Greens take on a gray color. Tea is never so good
made from hard water. For cleaning the skin, hard
water is not nearly so efficient as soft. Linens are
never of a good color when washed in hard water.</p>

<p>Boiling hard water before using it improves it.
A pinch or two of carbonate of soda, or of borax, is
helpful in washing. A little table salt improves it
for cooking most vegetables.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Filtration.</b>&mdash;The following is a simple home-made
filter. Take a large flower-pot, and soak it
thoroughly in clean water. Stop up the hole in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
bottom with a cork, in which insert a glass tube
about three or four inches long. The top of the
cork and tube should be nearly flat with the inside
bottom of the pot. Put in a layer of sharp, clean
sand about two inches deep, then two inches of small
gravel, and three inches of well-burnt animal charcoal.
On the top of this another layer of sand, and
then another layer of gravel. The gravel, sand, and
charcoal should be thoroughly washed before using.
If the flow of water is too rapid, it may be checked
by laying several flat pieces of glass upon the layers
of sand. At reasonable intervals, the sand, gravel,
and charcoal must be taken out, washed thoroughly,
heated in the oven, and replaced in the pot, which
must also be soaked in boiling water. This filter
will remove nearly or quite all of the inorganic matter
held in suspension in the water, but it is not to be
depended upon to remove dangerous microbes and
other germs of disease. If the water be thoroughly
boiled for half an hour and cooled before being
filtered, all danger will be removed.</p>

<p>There are many inexpensive filters on the market.
They all become clogged, in a little while, and need
to be cleaned or renewed. The cleaning of the one
described above is so simple that any housekeeper
could do it satisfactorily.</p>

<h2 id="FOOD_AND_DRINK">FOOD AND DRINK</h2>


<p><b>Why We Eat.</b>&mdash;During the early period of life,
and until we reach maturity, food is necessary not
only to repair the daily waste, but for the nurture
and growth of the body. The intense bodily activity
of childhood is attended with a large consumption of
material and a great amount of waste. The food is
converted into blood, which circulates through the
arteries of the body, carrying the nutritive particles
to the remotest parts, and returns through the veins,
conveying the waste and worn out matter to be expelled
from the system.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Quantity of Food.</b>&mdash;Placing the average weight
of an adult man at one hundred and forty-four
pounds, the average daily amount of food and drink
needed would be six pounds, or about one-twenty-fourth
the weight of his body. Food should be taken
in sufficient quantity to repair the waste, and no
more. Most persons habitually eat and drink more
than they need, while a few eat less than they should.
Those who lead very active lives, or live much in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the open air, require more food than the old, the
inactive, and the sedentary. Habit, too, has much
to do with the quantity of food taken. Over-indulgence
in eating is the fruitful cause of a long train
of evils. The appetite is pampered by tempting
viands, and the stomach is overtaxed with work.
The sensation of hunger is Nature’s demand for
food; the lack of such sensation should suggest
abstinence.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Mixed Diet.</b>&mdash;In infancy the digestive powers
are weak and undeveloped, and food must be taken
in its simplest form. Milk alone, at this period of
life, seems best adapted to sustain life and growth.
After this period has been passed, no single article
of food furnishes all the principles necessary to support
the growth, repair the waste, sustain the
strength, and preserve the health. A mixed diet,
therefore, becomes necessary.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Feeding Children.</b>&mdash;There is no greater error
in the management of children than that of giving
them animal diet too early. That portion of the
digestive apparatus intended to dispose of this kind
of diet is in an embryonic condition up to a certain
age, and in the efforts of digestion, inflammation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
possibly convulsions and death, may follow as the
immediate result.</p>

<p>Impaired digestion acquired in childhood is apt
to continue through life. The structure of the human
body being so largely dependent upon good,
wholesome food taken at proper intervals, the importance
of laying a good foundation in childhood
needs no argument.</p>

<p>The practice of allowing children to eat at short
intervals through the day is exceedingly deleterious.
Cakes, nuts, fruit and other good things, in carefully
regulated quantities, should form a part of the
regular meal, when the children are old enough to
have them, and should not be eaten between meals.
When it is remembered that one-half of all the children
born into the world die before reaching the age
of sixteen, the importance of children’s diet becomes
apparent.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Selection.</b>&mdash;In the selection of food, reference
should be had to climate, season, occupation, and
suitability. The races of the far North subsist
largely on the blubber of seals and other fatty substances.
In the winter season, persons living in the
temperate zones require more of the heat-producing
foods, and in summer, fruits and vegetables are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
more largely used. The man who leads an active
out-door life consumes more oxygen, and requires
not only more food, but of a kind that will rapidly
build up muscle and impart strength. And not the
least consideration, in the selection of food, is that
of suitability or adaptation to the individual’s condition
or peculiarity. “What is one man’s meat is
another man’s poison,” says the old proverb. Most
persons have found that certain fruits or vegetables
or other articles of diet, which are generally considered
wholesome, do not agree with them. It is
important that each individual should study his
peculiarities, in this respect, and abstain from eating
or drinking those things which experience has shown
will produce discomfort.</p>

<p>Happy is the man whose digestion is so perfect
that he is never reminded that he has a stomach.
But even those who cannot boast of such enviable
powers of digestion, may yet, by a proper amount
of exercise and the regulation of their diet, build up
health and strength, and lead lives of usefulness
and happiness, free from the many ills growing out
of improper eating.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Proper Food.</b>&mdash;Life is conditioned upon the
proper supply of food. Men may, and do, exist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
upon very unsuitable food. To be able to do a
good day’s work within the hours of a reasonable
working day is every man’s birthright. Many men,
like Esau of old, sell their birthright for a mess of
pottage. Unlike him, however, they are not pressed
by stress of hunger, but, merely to please the palate
for five minutes, they burden the digestive organs
for five hours, and repeat the process day after day.
The comparison, therefore, is rather complimentary
to Esau.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Constituents of the Body.</b>&mdash;As already remarked,
a large part of the human body is water.
The body of a man weighing one hundred and fifty
pounds contains less than fifty pounds of solid matter.
The blood, brain, and nerves are about eighty
per cent water; the muscles, nearly eighty per cent;
and even the bones and the teeth contain a large percentage
of water. Man may be deprived of solid
food for a day or more without suffering, and, in
some instances, persons have subsisted for several
weeks on water alone, but to be deprived of water
for ten or twelve hours causes much suffering.</p>

<p>The animal and vegetable kingdoms supply the
organic substances which constitute a large part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the material commonly known as food, and which
sustain the body in life and strength.</p>

<p>In addition, various inorganic substances enter
into the human structure, prominent among which
are salt, lime and iron. Salt is so important to animal
life that herds of wild animals have been known
to travel many miles to the salt-licks, or springs, in
search of it. Some persons, from habit, use it to
excess in seasoning their food. Lime and iron are
taken into the body through the food. Iron forms
about one part in a thousand of human blood.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Classification of Foods.</b>&mdash;For increasing weight
and producing heat, the fatty portions of meat,
butter, and lard, together with wheat, Indian corn,
and sugar, are best adapted; for muscle-making,
lean meat, peas, beans, oatmeal; for brain and
nerves, shell-fish, lean meats, peas, and beans.
Those who lead an active, bustling life, especially if
they take an abundance of out-door exercise, will naturally
crave strong food in unstinted supply. The
busy brain-worker, who is housed all day, and
scarcely rises from his chair, needs to be much more
careful in his diet. Coarse bread, lean meats, and
fruits should constitute his chief dependence, with
very limited use of butter, oils, and sugar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Proper digestion depends upon the power of appropriating
the food supplied, and this, in turn,
upon the needs of the system. The best of food
cannot be properly digested when it is not needed.
All that the system requires will be used, and the
rest will be cast out by the organs of excretion,
which are often overtaxed, and the vital forces
wasted, in the effort. The liver especially is burdened
in its effort to carry off the excess of carbonaceous
matter from the blood, and biliousness is the
result. On the approach of warm weather, when
the air has less oxygen to consume the food, this is
particularly true.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Quantity.</b>&mdash;We should eat to live, not live to
eat. More people suffer from over-eating than
from eating too little. Many thin people are large
eaters, and stout people are often small eaters. The
young generally eat more than the old. Not only
are their powers of digestion better, due in part to
the great amount of exercise they take, but they
need food for growth, as well as to repair the waste.
Franklin’s prudent rule was to leave off eating with
a good appetite.</p>

<p>Economy of the life forces requires that each
person should strive to find out just how much food<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
he requires to support his strength and repair the
waste. One ounce more than is required is a triple
waste,&mdash;a waste in the original cost, a waste of
muscular force in digesting it, and a waste of nerve
and vital force in getting rid of it.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Cereals and Their Food Value.</b>&mdash;Dr. H. W.
Wiley, Chief of the Bureau of Chemistry in the
United States Department of Agriculture, in speaking
of the substitutes for meat, says: “In so far as
actual nourishment is concerned, the very cheapest
and best that can be secured is presented by the
cereals, viz., Indian corn, wheat, oats, rye, rice, etc.
These contain all the nourishment necessary to
supply the waste of the body and the energy and
heat necessary to all animal functions and hard
labor, in a form well suited to digestion, and capable
not only of maintaining the body in a perfect condition,
but also of furnishing the energy necessary to
the hardest kind of manual labor. The waste material
in cereals is very small, and, as compared with
that in meats, practically none at all. In fact, the
ordinary wastes, such as the bran and germ, are
among the most nutritive components of the cereals,
and both health and economy would be conserved,
as a rule, by their consumption, instead of rejecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
them as in the ordinary process of milling. The
ordinary cereals of commerce contain only about ten
per cent of waste, and this is an exceedingly small
proportion, as compared with the percentage in
meats.</p>

<p>“If meats should be used more for condimental
purposes, as in the making of soups, stews, etc., and
not more than once a day, as one of the staple
articles of the table, it would be better, in my opinion,
for the health and strength of the consumer,
and especially would it be a saving in the matter
of household expenses.</p>

<p>“It is well known that men who are nourished
very extensively on cereals are capable of the hardest
and most enduring manual labor. Meats are
quickly digested, furnish an abundance of energy
soon after consumption, but are not retained in the
digestive organism long enough to sustain permanent
muscular exertion. On the other hand, cereal
foods are more slowly digested, furnish the energy
necessary to digestion and the vital functions in a
more uniform manner, and thus are better suited to
sustain hard manual labor for a long period of time.</p>

<p>“The cereals contain all the elements necessary to
the nutrition of the body, having in themselves the
types of food which are represented by the fats, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
nitrogenous or protein bodies, and the carbohydrates.
In addition to these, they contain those mineral elements
of which the bony structure of the body is
composed, viz., lime and phosphoric acid. If, therefore,
man were confined to a single article of diet,
there is nothing which would be so suitable for his
use as the cereals. Starch and sugar are primarily
the foods which furnish animal heat and energy, and
hence should be used in great abundance by those
who are engaged in manual labor. The workingmen
of our country, especially, should consider this
point, and accustom themselves more and more to
the use of cereals in their foods. When properly
prepared and properly served they are palatable, as
well as nutritious, and their judicious use in this
way would tend to diminish the craving for flesh,
which, however, it is not advisable to exclude entirely
from the diet. By persons whose habits of life
are sedentary, requiring but little physical exertion,
starch and sugar should be eaten more sparingly.”</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Preparation of Foods.</b>&mdash;No country equals our
own in the abundance and quality of materials for
the table, and probably no other compares with it in
the ignorance and carelessness displayed in its cooking.
A large part of the sickness, discomfort, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
unhappiness of life finds its source just here. In
many well-to-do families the whole matter is relegated
to ignorant and incompetent servants whose
only interest in the household is of a financial character,
and that is entirely one-sided. The mistress
is often more ignorant on this subject than the
servant, and the “queen of the kitchen” reigns supreme.</p>

<p>Among the middle and lower classes, where the
mistress is herself the cook, the results are no better.
Being without proper early training, or growing up
with the idea that it is not genteel to work, she
comes to her task wholly unprepared, and an ill-fed,
sickly family is the result. In many cities and
towns, cooking schools are found, but the graduates
do not compare with those who graduated from their
mothers’ kitchens, in the days when domestic labor
was respected. The mind of the ambitious cooking-school
graduate is too often concerned with the
pretty pastries and dainty desserts that please the
eye and pamper the appetite, instead of mastering
the art of properly preparing the bread, meat, and
vegetables, and the other substantial things.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Bread.</b>&mdash;So important a part does bread play
in the physical economy that it is often called the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
staff of life. In cities and towns and in many
country villages the baker supplies the general
need. Yielding to the popular demand for white
bread, he uses flour that has been robbed of its most
nutritious properties, and introduces unwholesome
substances to make it light and white. The best
bread is that in which the starch cells are most completely
burst. The making of wholesome, palatable,
home-made bread is becoming a “lost art” even
among farmers’ wives and daughters. The corner
grocery and the baker’s wagon furnish the freshly-baked
loaf, the housewife is spared some trouble, and
the household loses what should be one of the most
healthful, nutritious, and appetizing elements of the
daily supply of food. In parts of the South and
West, the large use of hot bread is the cause of
much indigestion and ill health.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Meats.</b>&mdash;Broadly speaking, there are two methods
of treating meats. By the first, it is the aim to
keep the juices within the meat, as in baking, broiling,
and frying. By the second, the object is to extract
the juices and dissolve the fiber, as in the
making of soups and stews. In order to imprison
the juices and thus develop the flavor, the meat must
be subjected to intense heat for a short time, so as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to coagulate the outer layers of albumen, and afterward
a more moderate heat should be employed to
complete the cooking. To extract the juices, meat
should be cut into small pieces, put into cold water,
and slowly raised to the boiling point.</p>

<p>Roasting is probably the best method of cooking
meats, especially large, thick pieces. Frying is the
worst method, as the heated fat penetrates the meat,
dries and hardens it, and renders it indigestible.
The American frying-pan is, beyond question, the
most deadly instrument that can be named. The
sword may claim its thousands, or even its tens of
thousands, but the frying-pan numbers its victims
by the millions. And yet the skilled French cook
robs even this destructive implement of its terror,
and furnishes the table not only with meats but with
whatever else has been fried, free from soaking
grease, finely flavored, and above all, thoroughly
digestible. The fault must therefore be ascribed to
the cook, and not to the frying-pan.</p>

<p>In an address on “Home Economies Among the
Poor People of New York,” the Rev. Dr. William
S. Rainsford declares that living expenses are entirely
too high. “The poor families of New York
are in a tight place. Food is not so cheap as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
should be. Fish, for instance, should be sold in
New York for half its present price.</p>

<p>“Because of these things it is growing more and
more difficult for young persons to marry. You
have no idea how dangerous this is.</p>

<p>“Another reason for suffering among the poor is
that the girls don’t know how to cook. One of the
best ways to hold even a fairly good man&mdash;not a
blackguard, but an average man&mdash;is to know how to
cook.</p>

<p>“This whole country is cursed by bad cooking.
It is worse in the rural districts. It makes my heart
sick to see the beautiful children, up to ten years, of
the Tennessee and Carolina regions, with the shade
of frying-pans spreading over their faces, killed by
grease&mdash;vicious and expensive grease.”</p>

<p>In commenting upon the above, a prominent daily
says: “Dr. Rainsford is by no means the first man
to hold that bad cooking is responsible for many of
the sins that men commit. It is well known that a
disordered stomach has a corresponding effect upon
the brain, causing men to hold views and commit
deeds which they would think of only with horror
under normal conditions; but this class of missionary
work, as it really is, has been much neglected by reformers
in the past. They are giving it more attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
now, and the cooking-schools, despite the
ridicule heaped upon them by the comic writers, are
doing good work toward raising the standard of
American cooking.”</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Veal and Pork.</b>&mdash;These are regarded as less
wholesome than beef or mutton. Both should be
well cooked, and ham, sausages, and other forms of
pork should never be eaten raw or imperfectly
cooked, on account of the danger of introducing the
animal parasite which produces in the human body
a serious and painful disease known as trichiniasis.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Superfine Flour.</b>&mdash;Chemists tell us that the
process of bolting removes from the flour not only
the outer woody fiber, but also the lime needed for
the bones; the silica for hair, nails and teeth; the
iron for the blood; and most of the nitrogen and
phosphorus required for muscles, brain and nerves;
and leaves only the starch which supplies fat and
fuel.</p>

<p>Experiments made upon animals show that fine
flour alone, which is chiefly carbon, will not sustain
life for more than a month, while unbolted flour
supplies all that is needed for every part of the
body. Wholesomeness and nutrition are sacrificed
to that which pleases the eye, alike by the baker and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the housewife, so that the fragrant, appetizing
bread of our grandmothers is almost unknown.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Potatoes.</b>&mdash;Potatoes are largely composed of
starch, which supplies only fuel for the capillaries.
Analysis shows that they contain only one part in
one hundred of muscle-making material, and less
than that of phosphorus for brain and nerves.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Animal Food.</b>&mdash;Many vegetarians denounce
the use of all animal food as constituting an unnatural
diet, oppose the slaughter of animals on
moral grounds, and declare that vegetables, fruits,
and nuts furnish all the elements necessary to the
growth, strength, and health of the body.</p>

<p>That a person may subsist, and even be strong
and healthy, without the use of animal food is proven
by the lives of many vegetarians in all ranks of
society. It is recorded of Louis Cornaro, a Venetian
nobleman, that for fifty-eight years his daily
allowance was twelve ounces of vegetable food and
a pint of light wine. In many countries the low
wages paid for labor and the high price of meat
compel the working classes to depend largely upon
a vegetable diet. The Spanish peasant is happy on
coarse bread, onions, olives, and grapes. The Italian
fares sumptuously on macaroni, polenta, olives, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
fruits. Over two millions of people in France and
other parts of Southern Europe subsist chiefly on
bread made from chestnuts, the annual crop being
estimated at fifteen million dollars.</p>

<p>In England and other countries in Northern Europe,
the eating of meat is largely a question of
wages. With the increase of prosperity, it has been
observed, there is a corresponding increase in the use
of animal food. In Spain, France, Italy, and the
warmer portions of Europe, the cooling acids of the
fruits and the less-heating elements of the vegetable
kingdom are better suited to the climatic needs of
the people.</p>

<p>Probably in no other country is so much meat
eaten as in America. The supply here is greater,
and wages, as a rule, are better. Many physicians
and others interested in domestic science are of the
opinion that the health of the people generally, and
of those leading inactive or sedentary lives in particular,
would be better if less animal food were
eaten.</p>

<p>Salted meats are not as nutritious as fresh. The
brine absorbs the rich juices of the meat and hardens
its fibers. Long-continued use of salt meats, without
fresh vegetables, produces scurvy, formerly very
prevalent on shipboard, in prisons, and in the army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Nutrition.</b>&mdash;The conversion of food into flesh,
bone, brain, and nerve matter, and the other parts
of the human body, is comprised in four somewhat
distinct processes: Digestion, Absorption, Circulation,
and Assimilation. We are apt to think of digestion
as a process belonging only to the stomach,
but it begins when food is put into the mouth, and
continues until the waste is finally excreted from
the bowels. The alimentary canal, or food passage,
including the mouth, gullet, stomach, small and
large intestines, is a tortuous passage, some thirty
feet in length.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Mastication.</b>&mdash;The first step is that of mastication,
or chewing. There are sixteen teeth in each
jaw. The front teeth are designed for cutting, and
the rough, broad surfaces of the back teeth adapt
them for grinding. The structure of the teeth
would indicate that man was intended to eat both
animal and vegetable food.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Teeth.</b>&mdash;The proper mastication of the
food demands that the teeth be kept in good order.
After eating, they should be brushed with a soft
brush and tepid water in order to remove the particles
of food that may be wedged between them or
lodged in the crevices. By reason of the heat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
moisture of the mouth, these particles soon putrefy,
which not only renders the breath unpleasant, but
promotes the decay of the teeth.</p>

<p>The enamel, or outer covering of the teeth, if destroyed,
is not formed anew. Sharp acids corrode
it. Gritty tooth powders, metal tooth picks, and
other hard substances scratch or crack it. Sudden
changes from hot to cold, in food or drink, tend to
destroy it. Do not attempt to crack nuts or hard
grains with the teeth.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Saliva.</b>&mdash;The food should not be swallowed
until it is thoroughly ground with the teeth.
While mastication is in progress, the salivary glands
moisten the food and fit it for admission to the
stomach. This saliva is the first chemical solvent,
and is an important factor in the process of digestion.
If the food is not retained in the mouth long
enough to become thoroughly ground and properly
mingled with the saliva, the work of the stomach
will be increased. Persons who bolt their food, and
wash it down with water or other liquid, thereby
dilute the natural juices of the mouth and stomach,
impose upon the latter organ a task for which it is
not adapted, and throw the entire digestive machinery
out of gear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>The sense of taste being largely dependent upon
the saliva, the natural flavors of the food are not
fully developed, the food seems insipid, and there is
created a taste for pungent sauces and spices which
over-excites the digestive organs. Poisonous substances
are often swallowed in mistake, which, if retained
in the mouth long enough to determine their
taste, would be rejected without injury.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Stomach.</b>&mdash;The most important organ of
digestion is the stomach. This is a pear-shaped
pouch, having a capacity of about three pints. The
walls are thin and yielding, and often become unnaturally
distended by those who habitually gormandize.
Its construction clearly shows that the work
of grinding and mashing the food was intended to
be performed before it entered the stomach.</p>

<p>The gastric juice, another chemical solvent, is here
poured upon the food, which, as rapidly as it is prepared,
is passed into the intestines. The time required
for the stomach to perform its work varies
from one to five hours, according to the quantity and
character of the food and the digestive power of the
individual. The delicate network of blood vessels
which underlies the mucous membrane of the stomach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
takes up all those elements of the food that are
ready to be absorbed.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Intestines.</b>&mdash;The small intestines are continuous
with the stomach, and, though very different
in shape, are like it in general structure. The bile,
which is secreted by the liver, unites with the pancreatic
juice, and enters the intestines through a
duct about three inches below the stomach. By the
joint action of these two fluids, the fatty elements
of the food are prepared for absorption. From the
mucous membrane, or inner lining of the small intestines,
still another juice or fluid flows, whose
office is to supplement the work, first, of the saliva
in converting starch into sugar; next, of the gastric
juice in digesting the albuminoids; and, lastly, of
the pancreatic juice and bile in emulsifying the fats.
The work of digestion is completed in the small intestines.
The indigestible parts of the food are
passed into the large intestines, and expelled from
the body.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Absorption.</b>&mdash;The liquefied food, in its passage
through the stomach and small intestines, has been
prepared by the various juices for its absorption by
the blood vessels and the lacteals, whose minute
mouths throng this part of the alimentary canal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
The food elements thus absorbed are conveyed to the
right auricle, or first chamber of the heart.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Conditions Affecting Digestion.</b>&mdash;The quality,
quantity, and temperature of the food, and the condition
of mind and body, all have an influence upon
digestion. In the selection of food, only such articles
should be allowed as are fresh, pure, and wholesome.
Bread should not be eaten warm. It is
more easily digested after being baked a day or two.
Flesh of animals recently slaughtered should be
thoroughly cooled, and never cooked while yet warm
and quivering with life.</p>

<p>Cooking renders many articles of food not only
more wholesome and palatable, but also more digestible
by reason of the increased temperature. The
natural heat of the stomach is about ninety-nine and
one-half degrees, at which temperature the operations
of digestion are best promoted. Hot soups are
therefore a good introduction to the meal. A small
glass of ice-water will retard digestion for half an
hour.</p>

<p>Sudden joy, anger, grief, or other strong emotion
or excitement checks digestion. If the tongue is
parched and the mouth dry, the flow of saliva is restrained
and the first step in the process of digestion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
is hindered. The coating of the tongue reflects the
condition of the stomach, hence the frequent request
of the physician to see the tongue of the patient.</p>

<p>Bodily fatigue destroys appetite and hinders digestion.
The expression “I am too tired to eat” is
not uncommon.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Intervals for Meals.</b>&mdash;Frequent eating is as bad
as rapid eating or over-eating. The organs of
digestion require periods of rest, in order to renew
their strength and restore the juices essential to their
perfect operation. No person, except infants and
the sick, should require food oftener than once in
four hours. If the stomach is in good working
order, it will usually complete its task in two hours,
unless the food is too great in quantity or too indigestible.</p>

<p>No one should take more than three meals a day,
and, to insure sound refreshing sleep and allow the
stomach to recover its tone, the last meal should be
the lightest and easiest to digest. Dyspeptics and
others affected with stomach troubles will find benefit
in restricting themselves to two moderate meals
a day. Numerous cases are cited of notable cures
effected by adopting a regimen of only one meal
each day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Regularity.</b>&mdash;Whatever the interval between
meals, be it four, five, or six hours, there should be
regularity. The stomach, like the mind, forms
habits, and the habit of regularity in eating will
beget the habit of regularity in digesting and recuperating.
The practice of parents in giving children
cakes, fruits, and sweetmeats between meals is reprehensible.
As a result of habit, many persons grow
to feel that a dinner is not complete without a substantial
dessert. The mistake consists, not always
in the dessert, for that may be as wholesome and
nourishing as any part of the meal, but in first fully
satisfying the demands of hunger, and afterwards
imposing upon the stomach the extra burden of
digesting the dessert.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Rest.</b>&mdash;For every disease of every organ the
first condition is rest. Broken bones and lacerated
muscles must have release from active duty or there
can be no cure. The vital organs, when diseased,
must have all the repose consistent with the operations
of life. For affections of the heart, the circulation
should be reduced, and all excitement and
stimulation to over-action be removed.</p>

<p>Excessive physical or mental exertion, whether
immediately before or after meals, interferes with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
digestion. If before, the energies of the blood will
be directed to the part of the body in most active
exercise, and cannot suddenly be withdrawn. If
after, they will be diverted before having performed
their legitimate part in the process of digestion. A
short period of relaxation before, and of absolute
repose after meals, is most favorable to the proper
action of the stomach. The repose should not be
carried to the extent of sleeping, for in sleep the
stomach, as well as the rest of the body, seeks release
from duty.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Drink.</b>&mdash;Thirst warns us that the blood is too
thick, or that it contains some acrid matter which
should be eliminated. Free perspiration makes large
demands upon the fluids of the body, and copious
draughts of water are required to supply the lack.
In this way the system is flushed, the clogged pipes
and pores are opened, the waste matter removed, and
the system made healthy. In cities the water is
usually introduced into houses through lead pipes.
Herein lies a danger, and the purer the water and
the newer the pipe, the greater the danger. The
water gradually corrodes the metal and holds a
small quantity of it in solution. After a few
months of service, an insoluble coating forms upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the inner surface of the pipe, and protects it from
further corrosion. It is a wise precaution to run
off the water that has lain in the pipes over night,
or during the temporary absence of the family, before
using.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Coffee and Tea.</b>&mdash;The Americans drink more
coffee and the English more tea, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per capita</i>, than any
other nation. As to the wholesomeness of these
beverages opinions are greatly at variance. Used in
moderate quantities, and especially by persons who
lead an active out-door life, no harm is likely to
ensue. Many persons drink them for the taste,
which is often heightened by the use of cream and
sugar, and never stop to question whether they are
injurious or otherwise. Such persons usually drink
too much. If either produces wakefulness, it
should not be used before retiring at night, and if
the nerves are unduly stimulated, at any time, its
use should be discontinued. Tea should be steeped,
not boiled. It contains a certain proportion of tannic
acid which is dissolved by boiling, and when
drunk, produces a deleterious effect upon the mucous
membrane of the stomach, causing dyspepsia with
its attendant evils. Children should not be permitted
to drink either tea or coffee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Intoxicants.</b>&mdash;While alcoholic preparations may,
in rare cases, be prescribed by the physician, their
use as a beverage finds no support in science or in
experience. There are many who use liquors and
tobacco and who yet live to an old age. It is also
true that many reach old age without their use.
Comparing the lives of a thousand persons who
drink and smoke, with a thousand others under the
same conditions who do not use liquors or tobacco,
it will be found that the latter are not only longer-lived,
but are also more healthy. Probably no better
test of the question of health and longevity can be
found than the experience of the life insurance companies.
By them, all intoxicants and tobacco are
looked upon with disfavor.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Circulation.</b>&mdash;The blood is the most important
and the most abundant fluid of the body. It constitutes
about one-twelfth of the entire weight of the
person. To the eye it appears as a simple fluid,
varying in color from a bright scarlet to a dark purple.
Under the microscope, it is seen to consist of a
clear, colorless fluid in which float a multitude of
corpuscles, or solid discs. These corpuscles are so
minute that thirty-five hundred, arranged side by
side, will extend only one inch, and fourteen thousand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
placed one upon the other, would not exceed
one inch in height. There are also white corpuscles
which are fewer in number, larger, and globular in
form.</p>

<p>The size and shape of the blood corpuscles in man
differ from those in animals. So important and
well-defined is this difference in point of law that the
guilt or innocence of criminals has often hung upon
the results of a scientific examination of the blood
found upon the garments of the suspected person.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Coagulation.</b>&mdash;The coagulation, or thickening
of the blood, when it leaves the living tissues, is a
principle of the greatest importance to life. Without
it, the slightest injury might prove fatal. In
minor injuries, the blood coagulates, thus closing the
mouths of the injured blood vessels, and bleeding
ceases spontaneously.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Heart.</b>&mdash;The great center of the circulatory
system is the heart. With ceaseless energy it drives
the blood through the arteries to every part of the
body, laden with the life-giving elements absorbed
from the food and vitalized by the oxygen in the
lungs. In the outward flow of the blood each part
of the body appropriates the particular elements
which it requires. The return of the blood through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the veins brings with it the waste and cast-off particles
of the bones, muscles, and tissues, to be expelled
through the lungs, except such elements as
exude through the pores of the skin. By this unceasing
round of waste and repair, the entire body,
it is believed, is renewed every seven years, and
some parts are replaced several times within that
period. From the moment a human being begins
to live, he begins to die.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Action of the Heart.</b>&mdash;The alternate contraction
and dilation of the muscles of the heart constitute
the heart-beats or throbs of the pulse. These
vary with the individual. In the average adult, the
number of beats is seventy-two per minute. In the
cases of Bonaparte and Wellington the number was
less than fifty. Heat, food, and exercise increase
its action, as cold, fasting, and sleep diminish it.
Emotion of joy, grief, and fear also exert a modifying
influence.</p>

<p>It is a matter of wonder how the silent forces
within a tree can lift from the soil, through its
minute pipes, and extract from the air, through the
small pores of the leaves, the many tons of material
that go to make up the giant of the forest. The
tons of physical energy bound up in that small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
organ, the human heart, is a matter no less marvelous.
Estimating the amount of blood expelled
by each contraction of the ventricles of the heart at
four ounces, we have a total of twelve tons a day, or
over four thousand tons in a year.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Assimilation.</b>&mdash;The crowning act in the conversion
of lifeless food into living tissue takes place in
the meshes of the capillary network, and is called
assimilation. This process is alike mysterious and
wonderful. By a peculiar power of selection, each
bone and muscle and tissue appropriates that portion
of the blood which it needs for its own development
or for the repair of the waste, and applies it in
such a manner as to preserve the form and size and
strength of the part, ever maintaining a proper balance
of the two sides of the body, unless thwarted
in its operation by some act of the individual.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Adulteration of Food Products.</b>&mdash;National,
State, and Municipal Boards of Health, and food
inspectors may do much to preserve health, but
when they have done all that it is possible for them
to do, much will still remain for the individual.
With the products of the world exposed for sale in
our markets, with the advertising pages of our magazines
and newspapers filled with irresistible arguments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
in favor of some newly-discovered breakfast
food or new preparation of canned goods, the need
of individual knowledge and caution daily increases.</p>

<p>There is cause for congratulation in the fact that
those articles which constitute the larger portion of
our food are but little adulterated. In the States
that impose legal penalties the proportion of adulterated
products is quite low. The value of a
stringent law is seen in the decrease of the adulteration
of cream of tartar, which, in Massachusetts, fell
from forty-two per cent in samples examined in
1879, to five per cent in 1898. Spices, flavoring extracts,
and canned goods afford the most promising
field for adulteration.</p>

<p>The substitution of ingredients is prompted wholly
by a desire for gain, and consists in the substitution
of a cheaper for a more expensive article. It is,
therefore, a question of ethics rather than of health.
If the horse-radish is largely turnip, and the apple-butter
chiefly pumpkin, if the currant or raspberry
jelly is made of the rich juices of the parings and
cores of apples, strained, colored and delicately
flavored, who will say that the cheaper fraud is not
as wholesome as the more expensive genuine article?
In some instances there is an actual advantage
to health in the substitution, but this does not justify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the deception. Pure, fresh oleomargarine, however
wholesome, should not be sold for butter, any more
than shoddy cloth should be sold for pure wool.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Dangers to Health.</b>&mdash;The contents of tin cans
are sometimes affected by the action of the acids
upon the tin or the solder. Food should not be allowed
to stand in a tin can after being opened. Milk,
cream, and butter are quick to take up germs of
disease. Scarlet fever and typhoid fever have, in
many instances, been traced to this source. The
utmost cleanliness and care should be exercised in
their handling.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Diet Cure.</b>&mdash;Over-indulgence in eating is
the source of many disorders of the system. It is
well, at all times, to keep within the limit of the
powers of digestion. The way to give the stomach
rest is to eat less food and at longer intervals.</p>

<p>Obesity is the result of the accumulation of the
fatty properties of the blood in excess of what is
needed to repair the waste of the system. The fattening
process will be stopped by cutting off the
supplies. A restricted diet, the avoidance of fat-producing
foods, vigorous perspiration as the result
of exercise, and frequent bathing, followed by friction,
will be attended by a decided reduction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
superfluous fat. A merchant in England who had
reached the enormous weight of four hundred and
fifty-seven pounds put himself upon a diet of four
ounces of animal food, six ounces of bread, and two
pounds of liquid in twenty-four hours. In one week
he had reduced his weight thirty pounds, and in six
months he had lost one hundred and thirty-four
pounds.</p>

<p>In France, there is a method of treatment known
as “The Grape Cure.” Persons in Paris, broken
down by the excitements and dissipations of the city,
go off among the vineyards, breathe the pure country
air, and live on grapes. From eight to twelve
ounces of bread, with grapes at discretion, constitute
their daily allowance of food and drink. By
this treatment the impurities of the system soon
pass off through the kidneys, the bowels, the lungs,
and the pores of the skin, and pure, wholesome blood
takes the place of that which was diseased.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Water Cure.</b>&mdash;The importance of water
can hardly be overrated. No life, whether animal or
vegetable, is possible without it. By water all food
is dissolved, and so penetrates the system and
nourishes the tissues. By water the waste particles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of matter are carried off through the skin, the lungs,
and the other secreting or excreting organs.</p>

<p>While the waters of many of the spas contain
medicinal properties, a large part of the virtue
claimed for the springs is due to the free flushing
of the system. It is the fad, while sojourning there,
to drink frequently and copiously. Any other pure,
wholesome water would be nearly, if not quite, as
beneficial, if used in the same quantities and under
the same conditions.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b>Influence of Dress on Health.</b>&mdash;While this aspect
of the subject of dress receives far less consideration
than it deserves, its importance is to be
measured only by the importance of human life
and by the value that attaches to a state of perfect
health. Like fresh air, pure water, and bright sunshine,
health is only appreciated when it is gone.
The behests of fashion often make sad inroads upon
it, but the seductive siren lures us on until we can
no longer follow. With scanty strength we then
worship at the shrine of Hygeia, but this queenly
goddess governs with stern rule, and is often unresponsive
to our petitions.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Temperature.</b>&mdash;There is a constant interchange
between bodies or substances of different temperatures
when they are in touch one with the other.
The warmer give off heat which is absorbed by the
colder, and in this way they tend toward equalization.
The normal heat of the average human body
is 98.4 degrees, Fahrenheit. When it is exposed to
a temperature lower than this, it must be protected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
by clothing to retard radiation of the body-heat, and
thus prevent not only the chilling of the surface but
also more serious disorders of the internal organs.
In very hot countries, clothing is worn as a protection
against heat. The head, especially, needs protection
from the sun’s rays.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Warmth.</b>&mdash;From the standpoint of health, no
other property of dress is so important as that of
warmth. While certain garments are described as
being warm and others as being cool, it is a well-known
fact that articles of clothing possess neither
warmth nor coolness in themselves. By reason of
certain chemical processes constantly going on within
the body, there is produced a degree of natural
heat, commonly called animal heat.</p>

<p>The body in health seldom varies more than one
or two degrees from the normal standard. Conditions
of climate, season, exercise, age, or sex have
but slight influence upon the average temperature of
the body. By conduction, radiation, and evaporation,
any excess of heat is quickly reduced. More
than seventy per cent of the whole amount of animal
heat lost passes through the skin.</p>

<p>Evaporation from the skin is very rapid, and may
lead to too sudden cooling of the body. A person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
who, after exercise that has produced free perspiration,
stands in a current of cool air, is apt to take
cold. The dryer the atmosphere, the more rapid is
the cooling process. The most uncomfortable and
oppressive atmospheric condition is that in which
the air is heavily laden with moisture and the temperature
high. Evaporation from the body is then
slow, and the sensation of heat is oppressive.</p>

<p>It is a mistaken notion that clothing keeps the
cold out. Its purpose is to keep the heat in, or, in
other words, to prevent the rapid radiation of heat.
We speak of warm clothing and of cool clothing.
That clothing is warm which retards the giving off
of heat from the body. The Indian wraps a blanket
about his body to keep it warm; we wrap a blanket
around a piece of ice to keep it from melting.</p>

<p>Any clothing that prevents the rapid escape of
heat from the body is said to be a bad conductor,
and is called warm. Woolen textures rank first
among dress materials as poor conductors, and are
therefore best adapted for winter clothing. Silk
and cotton come next. Linen is a good conductor
of heat; that is, it carries off the heat from the surface
of the body very rapidly, and produces a sensation
of coolness; therefore, all dress materials
made from flax are said to be cool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Materials.</b>&mdash;The principal materials used for
clothing are wool, cotton, linen, and silk. These
differ greatly in weight, texture, warmth, porosity,
power to absorb moisture, and in other less important
qualities.</p>

<p>In a climate so changeable as that which prevails
in most parts of the United States, the body, and
especially the trunk, should be protected at all seasons
from sudden chill by the use of under garments
containing wool. Even in the warmest weather it
will be found that a light woolen fabric absorbs the
perspiration, and is more agreeable to the skin than
cotton. The wearing of a flannel band, eight to ten
inches in width, buttoned around the waist next to
the skin, will prove an excellent protection to the
kidneys and the abdominal region. Silk is light and
soft, and as it retards the giving out of heat from
the body, is worn for under garments, especially by
those to whom wool is irritating or otherwise unpleasant.
Rubber cloth is useful for rain coats, but
as it prevents evaporation of the perspiration, it
increases the liability to chill, and renders the wearer
uncomfortable except in cold weather.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Animal Heat.</b>&mdash;The bird is warmer than the
air in which it moves; the fish possesses a higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
temperature than the water. As before remarked,
chemical changes are constantly going on in the
system which give rise to this result. Even plant
life is subject to this law. A delicate thermometer
placed among a cluster of geraniums about to burst
into flower will show a temperature a degree or two
higher than the surrounding air.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Warm-Blooded Animals.</b>&mdash;Those animals possessing
well-developed lungs and large breathing
capacity are usually active in movement, and are
classed among the warm-blooded animals. They
comprise birds, quadrupeds, and man. The animals
possessing small lung development are for the most
part inactive, and are cold to the touch, indicating a
low temperature. Such are the frog, toad, lizard,
snake, and tortoise.</p>

<p>These facts show the connection between respiration
and animal heat, the temperature being in proportion
to the amount of oxygen consumed. Birds
have the largest lung development in proportion to
size, are most active in movement, and indicate the
largest amount of animal heat.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Adaptation to Climatic Conditions.</b>&mdash;The Polar
bear suffers from the heat of the Temperate zone,
and would not survive a week in the Torrid. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
African lion would fare no better were he suddenly
transported to the Frigid zone. Man alone, of all
the animal creation, is able to adapt himself to the
extremes of heat and cold. By changing his clothing,
shelter, and food, he is able to create for himself
an artificial climate wherever he may choose to
reside. No Arctic winter has been found too cold
for a Peary, Nansen, or Greely to withstand, and
no African plain or jungle too hot for a Livingstone
or Stanley to explore.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Evaporation.</b>&mdash;The temperature of the body is
regulated by means of perspiration. Heat induces
perspiration, and its evaporation lowers the temperature
of the body. Cold retards perspiration, and
the heat is retained within. The principle of evaporation
is illustrated in the manufacture of artificial
ice. Men who labor in glass works, iron and steel
foundries, and in the engine rooms of large steam
vessels are exposed to great heat, yet enjoy as good
health as those who are engaged in other occupations.
Persons have been known to remain several
minutes in an atmosphere heated above the boiling
point, without materially increasing the temperature
of their own bodies.</p>

<p>Perspiration goes on continually, night and day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
This fact emphasizes the importance of a complete
change of clothing upon retiring at night, so that
the clothing worn during the day may be thoroughly
aired. In like manner, the clothing worn at night,
together with the sheets, blankets, and pillows,
should be aired, and, if possible, exposed to the sun
for a time, before the bed is made up.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Color of Clothing.</b>&mdash;The color of our dress is
not wholly a matter of pleasure to the eye. In general,
it is known that white is cool and black is
warm. Scientific experiment has shown that cloth
of the same material, when exposed to the rays of
the sun, absorbs heat in the following proportions:
white, 100 heat units; light yellow, 102; dark yellow,
140; light green, 155; Turkey red, 165; dark green,
168; light blue, 198; dark blue, 206; black, 208.
When not exposed to the sun, the color has little or
no influence upon the absorption of heat.</p>

<p>The color of underclothing has practically but
little influence upon the amount of heat radiated
from the body, but the color of the outer dress has
much to do with regard to the amount of heat absorbed
from the sun’s rays.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Absorption of Moisture.</b>&mdash;The property of absorbing
moisture is of much importance in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
hygiene of clothing. The best material for clothing
to be worn next to the skin is that which, while retaining
the natural heat, or giving it off very slowly,
absorbs the moisture from the body, and diffuses it
through its meshes. The skin is thus relieved of the
cooling effect of this evaporation, which might
prove harmful.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Porosity.</b>&mdash;The ventilating property of clothing,
or the ease with which air passes through its
meshes, is called porosity. The most porous of
dress fabrics is flannel, which is, at the same time,
the warmest. Its porosity, as compared with that of
linen, is as 100 to 58.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Impermeability to Water.</b>&mdash;As a protection
against rain, the simple mackintosh, or the mackintosh
cloth, is the best. The latter is more pleasing
to the eye, but the outer wool covering absorbs
enough moisture to add somewhat to the weight of
the garment, which is a slight disadvantage.</p>

<p>All waterproofs present this serious evil, that
while they exclude the outer moisture, they prevent
the escape of the natural moisture from the surface
of the body. This, however, is, generally speaking,
a lesser evil than to expose the body to storm and
cold, with the risk of serious illness. It is not unusual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
to add to the waterproof the further protection
of an umbrella. In such case, the discomfort
of excessive perspiration may be relieved by occasionally
loosening a button or two about the neck
and chest.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Underclothing.</b>&mdash;Taking all things into consideration,
wool is, without doubt, the best material
for garments worn next to the skin. In cold
weather it maintains the natural heat of the body.
In warm weather it quickly absorbs the free perspiration,
giving off the moisture through its meshes,
and thus preventing the too rapid evaporation from
the surface of the body, which tends to produce
chill and other resulting disorders. It also serves to
protect the body from the hot rays of the sun, and
from the heat of boilers and furnaces. No other
substance so effectually modifies the evil effects of
sudden and rapid changes of temperature. In the
extreme cold of the polar regions and in the oppressive
heat of the tropics, it is alike satisfactory. The
thickness of the texture and the closeness of the
weave must be determined by the climate and the
season.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Disadvantages of Woolen Undergarments.</b>&mdash;With
all their advantages, woolen undergarments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
are not wholly free from disadvantages. The most
common criticisms are that they are heavy, less
cleanly than linen, and they sometimes produce irritation.
For an equal weight, wool is the warmest
of all dress materials. For summer wear, only that
which is thin, light, and loose in web is usually
chosen. Light flannel suits have become very fashionable
for summer outing, both for men and
women.</p>

<p>Woolen undergarments rapidly absorb the excretions
from the skin. The water soon evaporates,
but the more solid portions are held in the fibers of
the garment. Woolen underwear should be washed
as frequently as that of cotton, linen, or silk. Unfortunately
for the health of the individual, it does
not show dirt so quickly as the other materials, and,
by the lower classes, is often washed less frequently
than it should be.</p>

<p>The therapeutic value of flannel depends in no
small degree upon its power to stimulate the skin.
It is this that makes it popular with the old, and
with those whose circulation is sluggish. For the
delicate, the scrofulous, and the rheumatic, flannel
undergarments are especially desirable.</p>

<p>Another objection might be urged to the use of
woolen underwear, in that it so often shrinks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
becomes hard when washed. It is possible, however,
to have flannels and other woolen goods come
from the wash as soft and light as when they went
in. Care should be taken not to subject them to
sudden and extreme changes of temperature while
washing and drying.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Effects of Tight-Fitting Underwear.</b>&mdash;A woolen
shirt or undervest, quite loose, will be much
warmer than a like garment of the same material,
close-fitting. In the loose garment, there is a constant
stratum of air between the body and the clothing.
This air has almost the same effect as an additional
garment. It acts as a non-conducting medium
between the surface of the body and the external
atmosphere.</p>

<p>Material loosely woven is warmer than the same
material closely woven. Clothing worn in successive
layers is warmer than the same quantity of material
woven in a single layer. Two shirts worn, the
one over the other, will afford more warmth than
the same quantity of wool or cotton or silk woven
into one garment.</p>

<p>Underwear should be light and porous, and permeable
to air. Very fine materials densely woven
are not so healthful as those that are more open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Night Attire.</b>&mdash;Night is the time for rest, not
only from mental toil and physical labor, but also
rest for the functions of the body, so far as possible.
To this end, it has been recommended that the evening
meal be eaten long enough before retiring to enable
the digestive apparatus to have completed its
work.</p>

<p>For many persons, cotton and linen are found to
be more restful, for night wear, than garments made
of wool. Even when woolen underclothing is worn
with comfort and satisfaction during the day, there
is, to some persons, a pricking sensation, a slight
surface irritation, in the use of woolen night wear
which is destructive of rest. The activities of the
skin, as well as the other bodily functions, require a
measure of repose.</p>

<p>The old, the delicate, and the very young may
use a light woolen night-dress outside that of linen
or cotton. If comfort demands the use of wool next
to the skin, it should be light in weight, finely
woven, and with a smooth surface.</p>

<p>Cleanliness and health alike demand that no part
of the clothing worn during the day should be worn
while sleeping. The garments worn in the day
should be thoroughly aired and dried during the
night, and the moisture absorbed by the night clothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
should be allowed to evaporate, and the garments
ventilated during the day. In cold climates
and in cases of sickness, weakness, or of delicate
constitution, the dress of the night as well as of the
day must be adapted to the requirements of the
case.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Hats.</b>&mdash;In the advancement from barbarism to
civilization, the head was the last part of the body
to be covered. Nature originally furnished, in the
form of a thick mat of hair, all the covering that
was necessary for the head. Baldness was then unknown.
While the demands of modern society
must be complied with, and hats must be worn, the
nearer we can approach to Nature’s plan the better.</p>

<p>A hat should be light, loose, and well ventilated.
A heavy hat presses with undue weight upon the
scalp. A tight-fitting hat interferes with the free
circulation of the blood. A hat that is close in its
texture, prevents the escape of the heated air within,
and not only produces a sense of oppression but is
believed to be the most fertile cause of baldness.
Silk hats for men are especially objectionable on this
ground. All close hats should be supplied with
efficient means of ventilation. The head, like any
other part of the body, perspires, and if the hat is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
removed in a cooler atmosphere or in a current of
wind, a cold in the head is apt to follow.</p>

<p>The chief cause of baldness is pressure of the hat,
which constricts the blood vessels and so interferes
with the nutrition of the hair bulbs. It is probable,
also, that the shutting off of air and light by the hat
promotes baldness. An unhealthy condition of the
scalp results, the sign of which is an excess of
dandruff.</p>

<p>Baldness is almost unknown among savages, who
wear no hats, and is comparatively rare with men in
the tropics where very light hats are worn. Laborers
are less prone to baldness than business or professional
men. They generally wear soft hats or
caps, which are often pushed to the back of the head,
so that the scalp gets plenty of light and air. There
is no good reason why, if properly treated, the hair
should not last as long as the man. Wear a soft,
loose, well-ventilated hat, and wear it as little as
possible, and never keep it on in the office or house.</p>

<p>In hot weather and in tropical climates hats
should be of a light color, with a considerable
crown and ample brim. In the United States, the
ordinary straw hats, if not too closely made, answer
every requirement. For the intense heat of Africa
or India, more elaborate head-gear is found necessary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
The ill effects of special exposure to the sun’s
heat may be reduced by wearing, in the crown of
the hat, a thin sponge, or even a handful of grass
or leaves, or other light, porous substance.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of health, but little criticism
can be made against the head-gear of women. Nature
has provided them with a splendid covering of
hair for warmth and protection. The woman’s hat,
or bonnet, is largely an object of adornment. Fashion,
at times, dictates an unequal distribution of its
weight, or an over-burden of ornament, or a lack of
protection to the eyes, but, for the most part, it is
light, loose, and admits of free ventilation. Veils
are more or less injurious to the eyes, and if worn
so as to cover the nose and mouth, prevent the free
escape of the exhalations from the lungs. The dyes
used in veils have, in some instances, been productive
of face eruptions and other disorders.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Neck.</b>&mdash;The improper clothing of the neck
is responsible for much ill-health. The high collars
for men, the tight-fitting high collars and neck
bands for women, the scarfs, handkerchiefs, and
other neck apparel in winter produce an excess of
heat. Cold air is inhaled, and the result is some
form of sore throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Fashion makes greater demands upon the powers
of endurance, or resistance, of women than of men.
To go warmly clad through the day, and then to
put on a ball or party dress, exposing the neck and
shoulders to repeated currents of cold air, requires
a degree of vitality that many do not possess, and
the physician’s and undertaker’s labors are increased
by the victims of fashion.</p>

<p>The neck should be comfortably clad, and kept at
the normal temperature as nearly as possible. It
is the sudden change from an over-heated neck and
chest to that of the opposite extreme that causes
the trouble. The boy who, with scarf tightly
wrapped about his neck, fights his mimic battle with
snowballs until the perspiration flows from every
pore, and then throws aside jacket and scarf while
he rests, and the girl who, in furs and tippet, skates
until she becomes thoroughly heated, and takes off
her wraps while she stops to breathe, have many
imitators among the older boys and girls in the
world.</p>

<p>As to the proper amount of covering for the neck,
much depends upon habit, and not a little upon individual
requirement. The important point is to
preserve uniformity, and to guard against sudden
changes. The sailor with neck freely exposed is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
fully as exempt from colds as is the soldier whose
neck is more warmly clad. If they should suddenly
exchange their manner of dress, the result would be
disastrous to both.</p>

<p>The important blood-vessels that supply the face,
head, and brain, and the jugular veins which return
the blood to the heart, all pass through the
neck. The clothing about the neck should therefore
be loose, so as to allow the freest passage of the
food, breath, and blood, and the fullest movement
of the head.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Male Attire.</b>&mdash;While appearance demands that
the outer clothing should be neat-fitting, comfort
and health require that it should be sufficiently loose
to admit of the freest movements of the body. It
should be as light as possible to insure proper protection
from the cold. Weight does not always
count for warmth. Many persons prefer light flannels
as outer garments for warm weather.</p>

<p>The trousers should be supported from the shoulders
by suspenders. Belts involve more or less constriction
of the abdomen, and are injurious. Men
suffer greater disadvantage from their use than
women. The practice of wearing a belt during the
summer months is especially objectionable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Female Attire.</b>&mdash;Healthful and proper clothing
implies, (1), the protection of the body against
extremes of heat and cold, and the maintaining of
an equable temperature in every part; (2), the absence
of all superfluous material and needless
weight; and (3), the non-interference with the normal
functions of the body.</p>

<p>Mrs. Woolson, a writer on Dress and Health,
says: The limbs have not half the amount of covering
which is put upon the trunk of the body.
Many garments have no sleeves, or sleeves that terminate
a few inches below the shoulders. As to the
legs, the clothing which should increase in direct
ratio to the distance from the body to the feet,
diminishes in the same ratio. Thin drawers, thinner
stockings, and wind-blown skirts which keep up
constant currents of air supply little warmth to the
limbs beneath. The feet, half-clad and pinched in
tight shoes, are chilled in consequence.</p>

<p>The trunk of the body has as many zones of temperature
as the planet it inhabits. Its frigid zone
is above, on the shoulders and chest; for, although
the dress-body extends from the neck to the waist,
most, if not all, of the garments worn beneath it
are low-necked. The temperate zone lies between
the shoulders and the belt, for that region receives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the additional covering of undervest, corset, and
chemise. The torrid zone begins with the belt and
bands, and extends to the limbs below; for all the
upper garments are continued below the belt, and all
the lower garments come up as far as the belt, so
that the clothing over the whole hip region must be
at least double what it is over any other section.
But it is more than double; it is quadruple, for the
tops of all these lower garments have a superfluous
fullness of material which is brought into the binding
by gathers and plaits.</p>

<p>It will be observed from the above that the three
rules laid down for a perfect dress are all violated.
First, the unequal preservation of heat; second, the
excessive weight, largely supported by the waist;
and, third, the constriction of the waist and pressure
upon the abdomen caused by the gathering of
so many garments at this point.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Petticoat.</b>&mdash;Petticoats are objectionable in
several ways. They seriously impede movement.
They involve an unnecessary expenditure of muscular
force by hampering the action of the lower limbs.
They stir up and accumulate the dirt of the streets,
or drag through mud and slush, often occasioning
wet ankles and engendering disease. Thick woolen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
drawers reaching to the feet, or, better still, the one-piece
underwear which covers the entire body except
the head, hands, and feet, would furnish more
warmth and distribute it more equally than the
“many petticoat” plan, and save the weight and
secure freer movement by enabling the wearer to
dispense with one or more of these objectionable
garments. This would add greatly to the comfort
of the wearer, reduce the weight of the nether garments,
prevent in large measure the undue heat of
the abdominal region, and would not materially
change the appearance of the outer dress.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Tight Lacing.</b>&mdash;It is said that Hippocrates
earnestly reproached the ladies of his time for too
tightly compressing their ribs, and thus interfering
with their breathing powers. Fashion and Health
must be sworn enemies, for they have not come
much nearer together since. We smile at the Chinese
lady who cramps her foot until it is neither
fit to look upon nor to walk upon. Yet, the tortures
she endures are no greater than those voluntarily
assumed by many American women at the
behest of the same tyrant, Fashion.</p>

<p>The unnatural constriction about the waist and
abdomen involves every vital function. It compresses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the lower part of the lungs, diminishes their
capacity, and thus interrupts the proper oxidizing
of the blood. It cramps the heart, and often results
in fainting and swooning, to say nothing of the
more permanent results of impeded heart action.
It forces out of shape and place the liver and
stomach, restricts the flow of the bile and other
stomachic juices, and seriously interferes with the
important function of digestion. It restricts the
action of the intestines, producing constipation,
with all its attendant evils. It presses upon the
blood vessels leading to the bowels and the lower
extremities, diminishes the circulation, produces
cold feet, and often causes varicose veins. And,
worst of all, those delicate organs peculiar to
women are so crushed by the unnatural pressure,
and so obstructed in their normal action, that the
function of motherhood is most seriously impaired,
the poor deformed woman becomes the victim of
untold suffering, and the wretchedness entailed upon
the race is widespread and far reaching.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>A Deformity.</b>&mdash;The devotee of feminine fashion
will doubtless resent the intimation that she is
deformed, or is likely to become so. A missing
finger or hand, a shortened arm or leg, an inverted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
foot or curved spine&mdash;these are set down as deformities.
In short, any wide departure from the
normal human structure must be classed as a deformity.</p>

<p>The bony framework of the thoracic cavity in its
natural shape is an irregular cone, whose apex is at
the neck, and whose widest part, or base, is formed
by the spread of the lower ribs. By constantly compressing
the waist, the flexible lower ribs yield to
the pressure, and after a time become fixed in this
unnatural position, and that which was the base of
the cone becomes the apex, and the widest part is
now near the top. From the standpoint of anatomy,
the latter condition can be nothing less than a deformity.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Are Corsets Ever Necessary?</b>&mdash;For any unnatural
or unhealthy conditions, the physician or specialist
alone must prescribe. There is no reason
why the bones and muscles of a woman, as well as
a man’s, should not support the upper part of the
body without artificial aid. As remarked in another
chapter, the body acquires habits. After wearing
corsets or stays for a time, their absence will doubtless
suggest a lack of support, for the muscles have
become weakened from a lack of use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>The skirts and other garments should be supported
from the shoulders, and not from the waist.
To this end, an under jacket, close-fitting, but in no
sense compressing the body, loose in texture so as to
be permeable to the air, with straps over the shoulders,
should be worn. To this, by means of buttons,
all the lower garments should be attached. No
steel or other stiff supports should be tolerated.
With this system in general use for a generation,
the amount of suffering saved would be incalculable,
and the advantage to the race would be beyond
compute.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Feet.</b>&mdash;In so far as the health is affected
by the dress, next to the evils of tight lacing come
the evils of tight shoes. The feet being remote
from the heart, the circulation of the blood at this
point is not as free as in other parts of the body.
This in itself tends to beget cold feet, and at once
suggests the advantage of warm stockings and stout
shoes in order to keep out the cold and wet, and to
induce a freer current of warmth-producing blood.</p>

<p>The small foot is almost as much an object of
worship as the small waist. The temptation to
cramp it by tight and ill-fitting shoes is great, and
is not wholly confined to the weaker sex. Large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
shoes may be ill-fitting and injurious, as well as
small ones, often rubbing the skin and producing
blisters and sores.</p>

<p>The shoes should be close-fitting but not tight,
thus allowing free circulation of air as well as of
blood, and also the freest action of the bones and
muscles. Like other parts of the dress, the shoes
must be adapted to the season. In cold and wet
weather the soles should be thick so as to keep out
the dampness. The maxim, “Keep the feet warm
and the head cool,” is none the less good because it
is old.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Rubbers.</b>&mdash;Tight-fitting rubbers impede circulation,
and, on this score, are objectionable. But
the disadvantages of wet or damp feet are far
greater. Through the winter and spring months
the streets and pavements are rarely free from
dampness, and light rubbers or sandals should be
worn. Persons who are exceptionally susceptible
to colds need to be doubly careful to keep the feet
dry and warm.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Stockings.</b>&mdash;The stockings, too, should be stout
and warm. For most persons, wool is the best material.
If the rough surface is uncomfortable to
the skin, those of a smoother surface may be tried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
A thin silk stocking with a woolen one of moderate
thickness outside will make no more bulk than a
single heavy woolen stocking, and will be found
equally warm.</p>

<p>Some persons when about to undergo extreme
exposure to cold wrap the feet with a thickness or
two of tissue paper, either under or outside of the
stocking. Being impervious to the air, paper is not
to be recommended for general use.</p>

<p>The physical annoyances and discomforts growing
out of ill-clad feet are such as to demand that
great care be given to this part of the dress. Corns,
bunions, and in-growing nails are so common that
it is a rare thing to find a person who is free from
these afflictions.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Heels.</b>&mdash;Heels of moderate height are desirable.
High heels throw the foot into the front of
the shoe, cramp the toes, and destroy the natural
action of the foot. The French heel, so coveted by
many ladies, is an abomination. It is not only too
high, but, being placed under the arch of the foot,
defeats Nature’s purpose in the construction of the
arch. Children under twelve years should not wear
heels.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Wide Soles.</b>&mdash;The width of the sole should always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
be greater than the width of the foot. With
the foot clad in a close-fitting, stout stocking, stand
upon a cardboard or piece of stiff paper, bearing
the weight of the body upon this foot. With a pencil
held in a vertical position, have some one draw
the outline of the foot upon the paper. When purchasing
a pair of shoes, apply this outline to the
soles, and see to it that they are larger at every point
than the outline. This will go far toward securing
comfort.</p>

<p>Infants require to be warmly clad. The heat-producing
powers of the organism are feeble.
Clothing should be of a kind and of sufficient quantity
to prevent the undue waste of natural heat.
Children are often clad too thinly, and exposed to
cold before they are strong enough to bear it. The
“hardening” process to which some foolish mothers
resort is accountable for no small amount of infant
mortality. The other extreme is equally reprehensible.
Aim to maintain an equable temperature of
the room as well as of the body; avoid sudden
changes, and keep the child out of draughts. Clothing
of fine soft wool, as a rule, is the best.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Evenly Distributed.</b>&mdash;The body of the child
usually is too warmly clad, while the arms and neck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
are often insufficiently covered. The long skirts of
infants are objectionable because they keep the legs
too warm and hamper them in their movements, so
essential to their growth and development.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Weight.</b>&mdash;The weight of the clothing of all
persons, of whatever age, should be as light as is
compatible with comfortable warmth, but it is a
matter of double importance to infants and young
children.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Constriction.</b>&mdash;Many young mothers have done
their infant children incalculable injury by tightly
pinning about their tender bodies the swathing
band and the upper parts of the skirts. The heart
and lungs, stomach and liver, as well as the rest of
the body, need room for growth. Instances are recorded
of infants having died from being deprived
of sufficient room to breathe properly. Here again,
the opposite extreme must be avoided. Socks that
come well up on the legs should be provided. The
dress should not be so loose about the neck as to admit
cold draughts of air to the chest or spine. As
with older persons, the petticoats and nether garments
should be suspended from the shoulders as
soon as the child is old enough to walk. The increase
in the average life of the American is largely
due to the better care of the children.</p>

<h2 id="BATHS_AND_BATHING">BATHS AND BATHING</h2>


<p><b>Why We Bathe.</b>&mdash;The first object of bathing
is cleanliness. The importance of this object is so
widely recognized as to have passed into a proverb,
“Cleanliness is next to godliness.” A second object
of the bath is to stimulate the functions of the skin.
A large amount of waste matter is thrown off
through the pores, and unless removed by frequent
bathing, soon becomes clogged, and sickness ensues.
A third object is the pleasurable exhilaration
which attends a plunge into the swimming pool,
stream, or surf. The street urchin, with no ungovernable
desire for cleanliness, and with little thought
of the importance of keeping his cuticle in good
working condition, plunges into the nearest stream
long before the summer days have tempered the
water to such a degree as to beguile his older
brother.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Skin.</b>&mdash;In order that the advantages of
bathing may be fully understood, it is necessary that
we have some knowledge of the nature and structure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
of the outer covering of the body. This garment
is soft, pliable, close-fitting, and quite thin,
yet sufficiently strong to resist the ordinary contact
with surrounding objects.</p>

<p>The skin is composed of two layers, the outer,
called the epidermis, or cuticle, and the inner, called
the cutis, or true skin. The two layers are closely
united. When, from a burn or other cause, a blister
is formed, a watery fluid separates the cuticle from
the true skin.</p>

<p>The cuticle is very thin, and is composed of minute
flat cells, arranged layer upon layer. These, as
they are worn out, fall from the body in the form of
fine scales. When the cuticle in the palms of the
hands or other parts of the body is subjected to
severe pressure, or friction, it becomes thick and
hard, and better adapted to manual labor.</p>

<p>The cutis, or true skin, is firm, elastic, and very
sensitive. Its surface is covered with minute elevations
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">papillæ</i>. These contain the blood vessels
which supply the waste of the skin, and also the
nerves which are largely concerned in the sense of
touch.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Its uses.</b>&mdash;The skin, which seems like a very
simple membrane in structure, is, in reality, a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
complex and elaborate organ. With its numerous
blood-vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves; its
millions of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">papillæ</i> and pores and sweat ducts; its
innumerable hair-follicles with their sebaceous
glands and muscles; its odoriferous glands and special
pigment-bearing cells, it is well equipped to perform
the various duties assigned it.</p>

<p>First, it serves to protect the softer parts of the
body which lie underneath it. Secondly, it regulates
the temperature of the body by preventing, on
the one hand, the too rapid radiation of natural heat,
and, on the other hand, by reducing the temperature
through the process of perspiration. Thirdly,
through its millions of pores, it is constantly throwing
off the useless materials found in the excretions
of the perspiration and the sebaceous glands.</p>

<p>In order that the skin may perform its functions
properly, it must be perfectly clean, the pores must
be kept open, and the sweat glands free to throw off
all the effete matter and prevent its accumulation
within the system. While soap and water are necessary
and helpful, free perspiration induced by vigorous
bodily exercise or artificial heat will also
enable the glands to cast off the more solid substances
which accumulate at the bottom.</p>

<p>An eminent French physician has discovered that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the annoying odors from the skin which characterize
certain persons have their seat in the bottom of the
sweat sack, and can be successfully removed by free
perspiration followed by a bath.</p>

<p>In addition to the general benefits to the health, of
systematic, vigorous exercise and the bath, they will
give freshness of color to the skin, prevent the coming
of wrinkles, and give to the face a beauty such
as no paint or powder can approximate. If ladies
with sallow complexions and shrunken countenances
would substitute exercise and bathing for facial
massage, the benefits of which last only so long as
its use is continued, the results would be much more
satisfactory.</p>

<p>Many of the common diseases of the skin which
destroy the beauty of the complexion are believed
to be due to certain microbes. If the skin were kept,
by exercise and bathing, in a thoroughly healthy
condition, these microbes would find no lodgment,
or, gaining a temporary foothold, would readily
yield to judicious hygienic treatment.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Hair and Nails.</b>&mdash;These, properly considered,
are appendages of the skin. The hair follicles
are hollow receptacles, from the bottom of which
the hair grows. Alongside each hair follicle are two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
glands, called the sebaceous glands, which provide
the hair with a natural oil or grease, and prevent excessive
dryness. This sebaceous matter tends to
keep the skin flexible, and serves to protect both
skin and hair from the acridity arising from perspiration.
The hair serves as a protection, shielding
the brain from extremes of heat and cold, and moderating
the force of blows upon the head.</p>

<p>The nails not only serve as a protection to the
ends of the fingers, but also enable us to grasp more
firmly, and to pick up small objects. Well-kept nails
contribute much to the beauty of the hand. They
are not only an indication of cleanliness but also a
mark of refinement.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Perspiratory Glands.</b>&mdash;The skin is provided
with numerous sweat-glands which consist of
very small tubes with globe-like coils at their deeper
extremity. It is estimated that there are 2,800 of
these glands to the square inch of the surface of
the body.</p>

<p>These glands or pores of the skin are, day and
night, constantly excreting a watery fluid. Ordinarily
this evaporates as rapidly as it is formed, and
the process is called insensible perspiration. Under
the influence of heat or exercise the flow is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
abundant, and appears upon the surface of the body
in the form of minute, colorless drops. This is
known as sensible perspiration.</p>

<p>This excretion consists of about ninety-eight parts
of water and two parts of solid matter. The quantity
of perspiration varies with the temperature, the
occupation of the individual, and other circumstances.
In an adult, the daily amount is about
thirty ounces, or more than nine grains a minute.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Benefit of Perspiration.</b>&mdash;Besides freeing the
blood of a large amount of water, with the effete
matter it contains, perspiration serves to reduce the
temperature of the body. This function is most active
in hot weather, and the cooling process is proportionally
increased, thereby contributing to the
comfort of the individual. A partial or temporary
check of this excretion is usually attended with
headache, fever, and other unpleasant symptoms,
and its total interruption is fatal. For the purposes
of experiment, rabbits and other small animals
have been covered with a coating of varnish, and
death invariably ensued in from six to twelve hours.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Importance of Bathing.</b>&mdash;As the watery portion
of the perspiration evaporates, the solid matter is
left on the surface of the skin, and soon clogs the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
mouths of the pores. The scales of the worn-out
cuticle also accumulate, and further impede the action
of the skin. These impurities must be removed,
not only from motives of cleanliness but also from
considerations of health.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>General Effects of the Bath.</b>&mdash;Bathing, in every
form, increases the activity of the internal machinery.
It increases the rate of respiration, the
activity of the heart, the rapidity of the circulation,
the combustion in the tissues, and the perspiration
through the skin. This increased activity causes a
degree of exhaustion, and makes demand upon the
vital forces. The reaction that follows more than
restores the depleted vitality, and the bath serves
as a tonic to the system.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>A Satisfactory Experiment.</b>&mdash;A prominent
Philadelphia merchant gives the following as a result
of his experience: “For a number of years I
was troubled with indigestion, and a feeling of general
depression. My muscles were soft and flabby,
and I was easily fatigued. I was seldom free from
colds and their many discomforts. Although there
were several gymnasiums near my place of business,
I felt that I could not take the time for practice.
My condition gradually grew worse, and the drugs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and medicines I took did me no good. In sheer
desperation, I concluded to see what a little exercise
and bathing would do. I chose the early morning
and the late evening, as interfering least with
business. Upon rising in the morning, and with
slight encumbrance of clothing, I devote fifteen
minutes to such simple body movements as give
exercise to the muscles of the arms, legs, upper and
lower trunk, and expand the chest. Then I stand
in the bath tub, and with a large sponge filled with
cold water, I quickly drench the head, neck, chest,
and every part of the body, and, after drying with
a soft towel, I give myself a vigorous rubbing with
a coarse towel, which produces a delightful glow
that lasts for several hours. At night, just before
retiring, I again devote ten or fifteen minutes to exercise,
and enjoy sound refreshing sleep.</p>

<p>“Since I began this plan of exercise and bathing,
some five years ago, my digestion has been excellent,
and I enjoy my meals, and seldom ask myself
whether it is safe for me to eat this or that, as I
used to do. I accomplish much more labor, with
less fatigue than formerly, and with none of the
old-time languor and depression. My mind is clear
and alert, and to my cold sponge bath I ascribe the
fact that I rarely have a cold.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Temperature of the Body.</b>&mdash;By a wonderful
provision of nature, the temperature of the surface
of the body is preserved at about 98.4 degrees
Fahrenheit, whether the individual resides in the
arctic regions or within the limits of the torrid zone.
The range of the internal heat of the body is not
very great. A deviation of seven degrees from the
normal is dangerous. If the temperature of the
body rises to 109 degrees or falls to 76, death is almost
sure to follow.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Temperature and Kinds of Baths.</b>&mdash;From the
standpoint of temperature, baths may be classed as
hot, warm, tepid, cool, and cold. A hot bath has a
temperature ranging from 98 degrees to 112 degrees
Fahrenheit; a warm bath from 92 degrees to
98 degrees; a tepid, from 85 degrees to 92 degrees;
a cool bath from 60 degrees to 75 degrees; and a
cold bath from 60 degrees down to the freezing
point of water.</p>

<p>Tepid, warm, and hot baths are employed, not
only for cleansing the body, but to diminish blood
pressure and to reduce nervous excitability. The
hot bath is used in restoring warmth to the body in
certain cases of shock, and to remove the effects of
exposure to a low temperature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>When the water is of about the same temperature
as the body, the effects are neither stimulating nor
depressing. In some forms of sleeplessness, a tepid
bath taken just before retiring has been found to
be effective. In such cases, the body should be covered
by the water for ten or fifteen minutes, and
quietly dried with a soft towel, without vigorous
rubbing or friction.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Hot Bath.</b>&mdash;The cold bath stimulates, the hot
bath facilitates function. Both hot and cold baths
increase the combustion going on within the body.
The immediate effect of a cold bath is to chill the
surface of the body. This sensation is promptly
conveyed by the nerves of the skin, through the
spinal cord, to the brain. Respiration and circulation
are at once increased, and the temperature of
the interior of the body is raised.</p>

<p>The effect of a hot bath is to raise the temperature
of the surface of the body and the temperature
of the blood. As in the case of a cold bath, the
respiration and pulse are quickened, and the escape
of carbonic acid from the lungs is increased.</p>

<p>Warm baths can be borne for a longer time than
cold baths, but if the temperature be very high they
deplete the system rapidly, and faintness is apt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
occur. The warm or hot bath leaves the skin in a
very delicate condition, susceptible to chill from exposure
followed by internal congestion. The
bather should dress quickly after a warm or hot
bath, and spend a half hour or more in a warm room
so as to allow the body to assume its normal temperature,
or he may go from the bath to bed, and
cover up well.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Popular Error.</b>&mdash;The belief is current that it is
extremely dangerous to enter a cold bath when the
body is heated or perspiring. The bracing effects
of the bath are most manifest if taken while the individual
is warm. The clothing should be removed
quickly, the plunge or douche boldly taken, and immediately
followed by a vigorous rubbing with a
coarse towel.</p>

<p>Some years ago, an eminent physician, desiring
to test the effects of the cold bath when the body is
warm, made a series of observations upon himself.
The following is his statement: “Every afternoon
a free perspiration was produced by a brisk walk in
the sun. As soon as the clothing could be cast off,
and while the body was still freely perspiring, a
plunge was taken into a fresh water bath of about
60 degrees Fahrenheit. No ill result followed. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the contrary, the sensation which immediately followed
the bath, and which continued for six or eight
hours afterward, was exceedingly pleasant. The
health remained perfect, and the weight decidedly
increased during the two months the practice was
continued. There is probably no danger to a healthy
person in this practice, but it is considered advisable
to immerse the head first, to avoid increasing the
blood pressure in the brain too greatly, which might
result if the body were gradually immersed from the
feet upward.”</p>

<p>The douche consists of a stream of water, hot or
cold, which is made to strike the body with force.
Its value consists partly in the impact of the water,
and partly upon its temperature. It is an exhaustive
method of treatment, and must be used with caution.</p>

<p>The Scottish Douche consists in the use of alternating
streams of hot and cold water, which produces
a powerfully stimulating action. Hot and
cold affusion are mild forms of the douche.</p>

<p>The Shower Bath differs from the douche in the
division of the streams of water, causing it to strike
the body with less force. This method, too, should
be used with caution, especially by persons who are
not robust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>The Needle Bath is a form of fine shower bath.
The bather stands within a coil of pipes perforated
with very small holes through which the finely
divided streams of water impinge upon every part
of the body.</p>

<p>The Vapor Bath combines the two agents, warmth
and moisture. The patient sits in a small cabinet
or other confined space, into which steam from a
boiler or kettle is conducted. In some instances,
the head is enclosed so that the vapor may be
breathed, but more frequently the head and face are
shut out from the vapor-inclosed chamber. The
vapor bath can be borne much better than the water
bath, the temperature often ranging from 120 degrees
to 150 degrees Fahrenheit. Various forms of
steam or vapor cabinets are advertised in the popular
magazines at small prices. The Russian Vapor
Bath consists of a vapor bath of high temperature,
followed by a cold douche, and is useful where a
quick reaction is desired. The Galvanic Bath and
the Electro-magnetic Bath consist merely of a bath
of water through which a gentle current from a
battery is passed. This is so arranged that the current
passes from the water through the body, and
affords a powerful stimulant to the skin.</p>

<p>Various forms of medicated baths are employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
for specific purposes, but these should not be used
except upon the advice of a physician.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Air Bath.</b>&mdash;The Hot Air Bath, since the days
of ancient Rome, has been not only a popular luxury
but also a means of treating disease. Unclad, the
bather sits in a room heated to a temperature of
120 degrees to 150 degrees. A glass of cold water
is sometimes taken to stimulate free perspiration,
after which the bather reclines on a marble slab and
is shampooed by an attendant. The body is then
thoroughly washed with hot water, and rubbed
down with a horse-hair glove. This is followed by
a cold shower-bath or douche, after which one is
rubbed dry, dresses, and reclines for half an hour
on bed or couch.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Sun Bath.</b>&mdash;The value of sunshine to animal
and vegetable life is apparent to all. Plants become
blanched and tender, and lack hardihood, if left
without sunlight. Fishes in the subterranean lakes
are dwarfed, and have no eyes. Tadpoles kept in
the dark never develop into full-grown frogs. Men,
growing up in mines or in dark prison cells, are
sallow and ill-formed. When Fashion smiles upon
brown arms and a tanned face, health is improved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and the darker skin is rendered more hardy and better
able to resist exposure.</p>

<p>Sand Baths have, at different times, been held in
high esteem. The patient is buried in sand, except
his head, and exposed to the full rays of the sun.
The surface irritation caused by the sand, combined
with the effect of the heat, produces a copious perspiration.</p>

<p>Mud Baths and Pine Baths are popular in parts
of Germany. In the former, the body of the patient
is imbedded, for a time, in the thick paste or mud
deposited by some of the mineral springs, or formed
of a mixture of moor-earth and water. In the Pine
Baths, a strong decoction is made of the fragrant
limbs and tops of the resinous pine trees, which,
blended with water, has a stimulating action on the
skin.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Surf Bathing.</b>&mdash;Sea bathing is more invigorating
than fresh water bathing. Persons who cannot
bathe in fresh water are often benefited by surf
bathing. The stimulating action of the salt water,
the impact of the waves, the exhilaration and excitement
occasioned by the incoming breakers, and the
wholesome exercise which usually attends a sea
bath, all contribute to the benefit of surf bathing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>While the danger of chilling and taking cold are
less in sea bathing, yet the usual precautions should
be observed. If warm, do not wait to cool off before
going into the water. This is always hazardous.
Plunge boldly in, taking care to wet the
head, neck, and face as quickly as possible. Exercise
to keep up the circulation. Dive through the
rollers, or jump up to prevent being overwhelmed
by them. If, after being in the water a few minutes,
there is a growing sense of chilliness which cannot
be overcome by exercise, the bather, for his own
safety, should withdraw at once, however enjoyable
the occasion, and seek comfort in dry, warm clothing.
A prolonged stay at the sea-shore will enable
him to renew his bath daily, and gradually increase
its length. At most, it should not exceed thirty minutes.
Persons of vigorous constitution may take
two dips a day with advantage. A short rest should
follow the bath, whenever possible. But if reaction
is not established by rubbing and putting on dry
clothing, it should be restored by taking a short
brisk walk before the rest.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Salt-Water Bath at Home.</b>&mdash;Aside from the
tonic effects of the sea-air, and the absence of business
anxiety and the change in food and habits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
which a temporary residence at the sea-side involves,
a good substitute for the sea-bath may be
had by the use of an inexpensive preparation of salt
which may be found at almost any drug store.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Reaction.</b>&mdash;The phenomenon commonly known
as reaction, which accompanies both hot and cold
bathing, is quite remarkable. Experiments have
shown that if the temperature of a healthy person
be raised or lowered by bathing, the subsequent reaction
will restore the equilibrium by supplying the
loss or withdrawing the excess. Thus nature seems
to resent any interference with her normal functions.
A German scientist subjected a robust patient
to a series of baths of a temperature of 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, each lasting twenty-five minutes.
The rapid abstraction of heat produced chilliness
and shivering, which lasted for several hours after
each bath, but this was followed, after an interval,
with such an increase of temperature as precisely
compensated for the previous loss, and thus the
average normal temperature was maintained.</p>

<p>The chronically ill may be divided into two general
classes, the one made up of those individuals
whose vitality suggests the possession of strong
powers of reaction, and for whom the system of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
heroic treatment, vigorous exercise, cold baths, surf
bathing, and sea air are best adapted; the other requiring
gentle treatment, much indulgence, mild
climate, warm baths, and mountain air.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Frequency of the Bath.</b>&mdash;The physical condition
of the bather must always be regarded as an
important factor in determining the kind of bath,
the length of time it should consume, and the frequency
with which it should be repeated.</p>

<p>A brisk, cold bath to tone up the system, prevent
colds, stimulate digestion, and promote circulation
may be taken daily. For many persons, the most
convenient time is just after rising in the morning.
Fifteen minutes of vigorous exercise before the bath
will add to its advantages.</p>

<p>Hot baths, if prolonged, are debilitating and
should be taken less frequently. To clean out the
pores and remove the excretions and dead cuticle
from the surface of the body, two thorough hot
baths a week will, for most persons, be sufficient.
Some persons get on very well with only one, especially
in the winter season when perspiration is
less active. The dust, grime, and soil, resulting
from one’s daily toil, must be removed from hands,
face, and body, as often as occasion requires. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
this purpose, a basin of warm water and soap will
be found sufficient.</p>

<p>Many weakly babes have been sacrificed to their
mothers’ vanity by subjecting the little ones to the
exhausting process of two or three elaborate baths
and costly toilets each day. Boys living near ponds,
creeks, or rivers often waste their physical forces
by spending a large part of the warm summer days
in the water. They go in too frequently and remain
too long. A morning swim of half an hour,
or two dips, one in the forenoon and another in the
afternoon, of twenty minutes each, is as much as the
strongest boy should take.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Regularity.</b>&mdash;In bathing, as in exercise, regularity
and system should control, if any physical
advantage is expected to follow. A bath now and
then, when it happens to suit the convenience of the
bather, will not tone up the system nor fortify it
against colds. A daily cold bath is best. If that is
impossible, it should be taken at least three or four
times a week.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Best Time for Bathing.</b>&mdash;As remarked elsewhere,
every form of bath makes greater or less demand
upon the vital forces, and some forms are
quite exhausting. It is therefore proper to consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the most suitable times for bathing. It is best not
to take a bath when the body is much exhausted,
nor to engage in intense physical or mental exercise
immediately after a bath.</p>

<p>Under no circumstances should a bath be taken
directly after a full meal. Generally speaking the
most appropriate time is from two to three and a
half hours after a meal, preferably near the noon
hour.</p>

<p>For the cold bath, taken quickly, no time is better
than just after rising. A warm bath just before retiring
will quiet the nerves and assist in producing
sleep.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Value of Soap.</b>&mdash;The eminent chemist,
Liebig, asserts that the civilization of a nation is
high in proportion to the amount of soap it consumes,
and that it is low in proportion to its use of
perfumes. The cleanliness and refinement of an
individual may be measured by the same test. Soap
removes impurity; perfume is often employed to
conceal it.</p>

<p>Many soaps are positively injurious to the skin.
In this, as in other matters, judgment and caution
must be exercised. A free use of a good skin soap,
with warm or hot water, may be recommended for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the weekly or semi-weekly bath when the primary
object is cleanliness. The soapy lather should be
vigorously rubbed over the body, by the hand or a
small coarse towel, so as to remove all excretions
from the pores, all greasy deposits of the sebaceous
glands, and all dead scales from the cuticle.</p>

<p>This lather must be carefully rinsed off before
rubbing with the towels. For the cold tonic and
other baths, it is better not to use soap.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Cosmetics.</b>&mdash;The use of cosmetics for the complexion
is a fertile source of disease. Many of these
preparations contain lead and other poisonous mineral
substances. The skin readily absorbs these, and
the most distressing conditions often ensue.</p>

<p>Hair-dyes also contain lead and other objectionable
ingredients. Although less harmful than cosmetics,
being generally kept away from the skin,
they rob the hair of its lustre and vitality, and should
be avoided.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Caution.</b>&mdash;Bathing, whether for cleanliness or
for recreation, is a most healthful exercise, yet certain
precautions are necessary.</p>

<p>1. Avoid bathing within two and a half hours
after a meal. The sudden interruption of the process
of digestion, especially by a cold bath, is apt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
produce nausea. Cases of drowning, usually ascribed
to cramps, have been due, in some instances,
to interrupted digestion.</p>

<p>2. Avoid bathing when exhausted by fatigue, or
from any other cause.</p>

<p>3. Avoid bathing when the body is cooling after
perspiration.</p>

<p>4. Avoid bathing in stream or surf if experience
proves that after being a short time in the water,
there is a sense of chilliness, with numbness of the
hands or feet.</p>

<p>5. Avoid chilling the body by sitting or standing
undressed, either before going into or coming out
of the water.</p>

<p>6. Avoid remaining too long in the water. Rub
briskly and dress quickly upon the first sensation of
chilliness.</p>

<p>7. The best time for bathing is two or three
hours after breakfast. The vigorous and strong may
safely take a cold bath before breakfast; the weakly
and the young should not attempt it.</p>

<p>8. Those who are subject to dizziness or faintness,
should not bathe in stream or surf without
first consulting a physician.</p>

<p>9. Avoid a warm or hot bath, if liable to be exposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
to a low temperature within two or three
hours after the bath.</p>

<p>10. Women should carefully consult their physical
condition before venturing to take a cold bath.</p>

<p>11. All persons suffering from organic heart disease
should avoid surf bathing.</p>

<h2 id="PHYSICAL_EXERCISE">PHYSICAL EXERCISE</h2>


<p>Physical exercise is necessary to the preservation
of the health and the cultivation of the strength of
the body. By the contraction of a muscle, the circulation
of the blood is stimulated, and demand is
made upon the supply of food material to replace
that which has been consumed. The action of the
respiratory process is accelerated, a larger quantity
of air is taken into the lungs, more oxygen is absorbed
by the blood, and greater tone is imparted to
the system. Perspiration is also promoted, effete
matters are expelled through the pores of the skin,
and the general health is improved.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Definiteness of Purpose.</b>&mdash;The person who
doesn’t know where he is going, never gets there.
Know what you are going to do, then do it. There
are about four hundred muscles in the human body.
It is clearly evident that they cannot all be trained
at the same time, nor is it necessary or even desirable
that they should be. Those exercises having
the most direct bearing upon the specific needs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the individual will naturally come first. If he is
troubled with indigestion, two-thirds of the time
that he allows himself for daily exercise should be
given to remedying that defect, and the rest to supplying
some other important need which will bring
into play a different set of muscles. If his lung
capacity is inadequate, the larger share of time
should be given to the correction of this weakness.
If shortness of breath and interference with heart
action are occasioned by increasing fleshiness, the reduction
of his superfluous fat must receive first consideration.</p>

<p>The important thing is to determine what is most
needed at any stage of the work, and to strike directly
at that point. As, one after another, the special
points of weakness are covered, the exercises
will gradually take on more and more of an all-round
character. As so many of the infirmities of
the flesh have their rise in impaired digestion, imperfect
respiration, or sluggish circulation, the exercises
having relation to these three subjects will
always claim attention, not only to secure but also
to preserve health.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Mind Engaging.</b>&mdash;While those whose mental
energies have been on a strain may find relief in exercises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
somewhat automatic, the most beneficial and
satisfactory results, as a rule, are obtained when the
mind is kept on the alert and the eye is brought into
active play, as in fencing and sparring, or when the
exercise contributes to the enjoyment of the individual,
and is not self-imposed as an irksome task or an
unpleasant duty. The presence and co-operation of
a congenial friend adds much to the value of the
exercise. Where this is not convenient, the drill
should be so varied in kind and in degree, from day
to day, as to sustain the interest. Without this, the
exercises are apt to be abandoned, or, if continued,
they will not be attended with the best results.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Intensity.</b>&mdash;Much valuable time is wasted by
persons who engage in a certain kind of exercise,
not because they are interested in it, but because it
happens to be the fad. Whether it be walking, running,
swimming, golf, tennis or croquet, they go at
it in such a feeble, listless manner as to excite pity
rather than enthusiasm.</p>

<p>It is said of President Roosevelt that the only
exercise he really enjoys is of that strenuous character
which, to most men, would be hard work.
Gladstone could give him no points in felling trees,
and the cowboys of the plains, after numerous tests,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
were satisfied that he wore the title of “Rough
Rider” by right. It was on one of his western hunting
trips that he went two days with two ribs
broken, not deigning to mention the circumstance
lest it might offend cowboy etiquette to speak of
such insignificant matters amid the excitement of
the final round-up.</p>

<p>Few men carry the burden of a weightier responsibility
than the President, or have more exacting
demands made upon their time. No one would have
a better right to plead pressure of business as an
excuse for taking no physical exercise. On the
other hand, no one has greater need of a strong
body and a clear brain. Appreciating this fact, his
vigorous ride on horseback becomes almost as indispensable
as his meals or his sleep, and it is
rumored that this is often supplemented by a quiet
bout with the gloves. Remembering that, as a
child, his body was rather frail, his present rugged
health bears strong testimony to the value of persistent
vigorous exercise.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Walking.</b>&mdash;Rapid walking is one of the best
methods of physical exercise. It not only develops
the muscles of the legs and thighs, but increases the
capacity of the chest. One of its chief advantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
is that it is an out-door exercise. Running is still
more stimulating, and gives increased activity to
the muscles of the limbs and body, and to the organs
of respiration.</p>

<p>By combining walking and running with some
simple form of in-door exercise, as dumb-bells, Indian-clubs,
or pulley weights, a person will have
nearly all the advantages of a fully-equipped gymnasium.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Over Exertion.</b>&mdash;Severe labor and violent exercise
should be avoided. Many cases of broken-down
health are due to excessive strain, the result
of track races on wheel or foot, and similar indiscretions.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Age, Occupation, and Habit.</b>&mdash;Physical exercises
must be chosen with reference to the age, occupation,
and habit of the individual. The young,
the middle-aged, and the old will each, as a rule,
require some direction as to kind, and some modification
as to length and intensity, of the exercise.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Childhood and Youth.</b>&mdash;Healthy children are
never at rest except when asleep. This is the
prompting of their nature. Their games and plays
should therefore be directed, but not too much restrained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
If, however, the natural increase in size
and weight of a child’s body does not keep pace with
its years, it would be well for the parent to inquire
whether that result is due to excessive exercise,
or to some other cause.</p>

<p>Proper habits of sitting, standing, and walking,
if not attained during youth, are rarely acquired
afterward. The habit of a graceful carriage and a
manly or womanly bearing should be established
before the age of sixteen. But the exercises that
most closely affect the health are those which relate
to the expansion of the chest. The lungs vitalize
and purify the blood. The larger their capacity,
the more satisfactorily will they accomplish their
work. With a good supply of pure blood, the
growth and health and vigor of the body will be
largely provided for.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Middle Life.</b>&mdash;While judgment and discretion
in the kinds of exercises, and in the manner of doing
them, are, at every period of life, desirable, persons
from 20 to 35 years of age are able to undertake
severer tasks and to withstand greater shocks
to the system than the young or the old. Persons
from 35 to 50 years of age may take long walks but
should be cautious about rapid running. At this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
age exercises requiring endurance and persistence
are better than those demanding intensity or violence.
This is especially applicable to those whose
occupation is sedentary. Any hereditary tendency
to disease is apt to show itself during this period,
and should be carefully watched by the individual
and by his physician, for by it the kind and degree
of the exercise should be determined.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Old Age.</b>&mdash;Unless the habit of taking physical
exercise has been pursued more or less constantly
through life, persons in advanced years, especially
if feeble, need to observe great caution in beginning
it, on account of the unusual strain upon the
heart and blood-vessels. Their native power of resistance
being small, any severe shock or strain upon
the system may be attended with serious results.
William Cullen Bryant, at eighty years of age, took
an hour of severe exercise, followed by a cold bath,
before breakfast, then walked three miles to his
office and back again, in all states of weather, but he
had kept up his physical training through life, and
found in it a pleasure as well as a benefit to health.</p>

<p>With increasing years, the duties and responsibilities
of the busy man increase. Instead of the
walk or the ride on horseback, the stately coach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
which more fittingly represents his growing wealth,
is now used for his afternoon recreation, the coachman
relieving him of even the mental and physical
stimulus of driving. Wealth is a menace to health,
so far as it tends to discourage the simple living
upon which health depends.</p>

<p>A much wiser course would be to keep the human
machinery oiled and in good condition, by systematic
exercise. Hinges of iron and steel must be oiled
and used to keep them from creaking and rusting.
The membrane that secretes the lubricating fluid
and supplies it to the opposing surfaces of the bones
and to the ligaments which surround them is stimulated
to activity by the motion of the joint itself.
Stiffening joints, sluggish circulation, and torpid
liver are the sure penalties of inactivity.</p>

<p>Some years ago, two prominent business men, one
sixty-four, the other sixty-three years of age, engaged
in a walking contest. The younger walked
209 miles, the older 211 miles in three and one-half
days, an average of sixty miles a day. James Russell
Lowell was unwilling to ride when he could
possibly walk. Gladstone was famous as an ax-man
as well as a statesman, and continued this exercise
nearly to the end of his life. Instances of great
mental activity after seventy are almost invariably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
those of men who have kept up since early manhood
a constant habit of vigorous daily exercise. It is
only in this way that the arteries are kept from
hardening, and that the brain is kept supplied with
the blood to renew its cells.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Physical Culture for School Children.</b>&mdash;In
childhood and youth, bad habits are easily corrected
and good ones established. If the chest is
weak and flat, this is the time to remove the defect.
If one shoulder is a trifle higher than the other, correct
the default before it becomes confirmed. Build
up the arms and shoulders and chest to be strong
and well shaped. It is in youth, while the bones are
elastic, that the perfect frame must be built. Accustom
the muscles of the trunk and limbs to healthy
and graceful action. This becomes easy and natural,
when given proper direction, and will result in
making a vigorous, well-built man or woman, capable
of meeting the difficulties and discharging the
duties that come alike to all.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Over-Study.</b>&mdash;A prominent magazine recently
devoted a page to brief statements of parents,
teachers, and physicians, testifying in eloquent but
most pathetic terms to the crying evils of over-study
and the lack of physical recreation. In reply
to the questions asked, one physician says, “Twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
children are under my professional care from over-study.”</p>

<p>Another writes, “During the last school year I
treated over forty children suffering from over-study.
In more than thirty of the cases I had to
advise withdrawal from school.”</p>

<p>A parent says, “We have four daughters, and
had to take all of them out of school.”</p>

<p>From the sufferers themselves we have, “At
seventeen I broke down. Today, at thirty, I am
still an invalid.”</p>

<p>“For twelve years I, a young woman, have tried
to overcome nervous prostration, directly brought
on by over-study.”</p>

<p>“Pushed beyond my endurance as a child, I am
to-day a nervous mother with children so nervous
that it is pitiable.”</p>

<p>“An ambitious father caused me to be shattered
in nerves before I was sixteen. My bed has ever
since been almost my constant companion.”</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Remedy.</b>&mdash;In the face of the above deplorable
facts, it is evident that, with all our boasted improvement
in the system of education, there is something
sadly lacking. Proper attention given to
physical exercise and recreation, with sufficient time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
for sleep, would have saved the lives and established
the health, not only of the few cases above cited, but
of thousands of others as well.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Physical Education Compulsory.</b>&mdash;Physical
culture should be made compulsory in every school
in the land. The teacher should be as fully equipped
in this as in any other department of his work.
In cities and in towns of considerable size the matter
should be under the direction of a competent
specialist, who would infuse life and energy into
the work, and hold the teachers to their duty.
Shirking, whether by teachers or scholars, should
be strictly prevented. Fifteen minutes, twice a day,
in the lower grades, and thirty minutes, once a day,
in the upper grades, would serve to put the children
in good physical condition.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Caution.</b>&mdash;The enthusiasm and alacrity with
which children take hold of physical training afford
encouragement to the doubting teacher, and, at the
same time, prove the need of constant watchfulness.
Suppose, in a class of forty, one-fourth of them have
flat, weak chests. These should be formed into a
special class, and ten minutes a day devoted to the
one purpose of enlarging the chest. Begin very
mildly, so that the weakest chest will experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
neither pain nor ache from the exercise. Repeat
this work daily for a week, without increase, and
do not miss a stroke. Miss any other drill rather
than this. The second week, the exercises may be
made a trifle harder, or longer, or both. If apparatus
is used, see to it that the pupils do not get
hold of heavy pieces, or attempt more difficult exercises
than they are prepared for. Overdoing here
is as bad as over-study. Strict discipline must be
preserved, and the same thoughtful attention given
to this as to any other department of study.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Illustrations of the Results of Physical Training.</b>&mdash;Wherever
physical education has been
tested in the schools, of whatever grade, and in
whatever country, the results have furnished the
most abundant proof of its value. Doctor Sargent,
one of the most eminent instructors in physical education
in this country, gives the results of six
months’ training with a class of two hundred young
college men, devoting to it only one-half hour a
day, four times a week. The only apparatus used
was light dumb-bells, Indian-clubs, and pulley-weights.
The average age was 18.3 years. The
average increase in height was one-fourth of an
inch; in weight, two pounds; in chest (contracted),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
¾ inch; in chest (inflated), 1¾ inches; in girth
of forearm, ¾ of an inch; of upper arm, 1 inch; in
width of shoulders, ¾ inch; in girth of hips, 2¼
inches; of thigh, 1½ inches; of calf, ¾ inch.</p>

<p>Prof. Maclaren, of England, gives the results of
four and one-half months’ training, with a class of
boys from the Royal Military Academy, ranging
in years from sixteen to nineteen. The increase in
height was from 1 to 1¾ inches; in weight, from
1 to 8 pounds; in girth of chest, from ½ to 5¼
inches; forearm, from ⅛ to ½ inch; upper arm,
from ½ to 1⅝ inches. With a class of older persons,
nineteen to twenty-eight years, he reports the
largest gain in weight, 16 pounds, with an average
gain of 10 pounds; in girth of chest, 5 inches, with
an average of 2⅞ inches; of forearm, 1¼ inches,
with an average of ¾ inch; upper arm, 1¾ inches,
with an average of 1¹/₁₆ inches. These gains were
made in 7⅔ months.</p>

<p>Prof. Maclaren gives a humorous account of
twelve non-commissioned officers who had been selected
from different branches of the service, and
sent to him to qualify as instructors in the British
Army. These men ranged in years from nineteen
to twenty-nine; in height, from five feet five inches
to six feet; in weight, from 128 to 174 pounds, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
all had seen service. He says, “The muscular additions
to the arms and shoulders, and the expansion
of the chest were so great as to have absolutely
a ludicrous and embarrassing result. Before the
fourth month, several of the men could not get into
their uniforms without assistance, and when they
had got them on, they could not get them to meet
by a hand’s breath. In a month more, they could
not get into them at all, and new clothes had
to be procured, pending the arrival of which
the men had to go to and from the gymnasium in
their great coats. One of these men had gained
five inches in actual girth of chest.” In the case
of the youngest, he reports “a readjustment and
expansion of the osseous framework upon which
the muscles are distributed.”</p>

<p>This case is important as proving that proper
physical exercise will materially change even the
bony structure of the body. What a source of comfort
and encouragement to the young man or woman
who is hollow-chested, and who considers himself
or herself a marked victim of that dread disease,
consumption.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Need of Exercise for Girls.</b>&mdash;If it be conceded
that there is need of physical exercise for boys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
what must be said of the need of it for girls? Observe
the young girls of cities and towns as they
pass to and from school. Instead of the high chests,
plump arms, comely figures, and graceful and handsome
carriage, what do we constantly see? Flat
chests, angular and warped shoulders, scrawny
necks, slender arms and waists, and a weak and
tired gait. Scarcely one in a dozen is thoroughly
erect, whether walking, standing, or sitting. There
is no elasticity in their steps, and a fresh, blooming
complexion is so rare as to attract attention.</p>

<p>The girls of the most favored families often
show the poorest physical development. The
tyranny of fashion begins at a very early period in
life. The quality and fit of the clothing worn by
girls from ten to thirteen years of age prevent
them from engaging in active, hearty play. The
nurse or governess finds a large share of her duty
in repressing that superabundance of spirits which
should belong to every healthy girl.</p>

<p>As the years increase, the studies multiply, and
by the time she is ready to leave school and assume
the duties of life, we find a brain-weary, nerve-exhausted,
pale creature, with no physical development,
no power of endurance, and no ambition to
undertake her share of life’s duties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>When the importance of physical culture is as
well understood as it should be, there will be a
course of training for pupils of all ages in every
girls’ school in the land. In the larger cities and
towns, provision is now made for physical instruction
in many of the High Schools, but in the middle
and lower grades, where the foundation should be
laid and the work begun, the subject is almost
wholly neglected. Bad habits of sitting, standing,
walking, and breathing are acquired, and many
forms of structural weakness developed which not
only unfit the mind for the best work, but which
later either become ineradicably fixed, or require
much time and labor to correct. The schoolgirl, if
systematically trained from early childhood, would
show similar fruits of drill, and would develop into
a shapely, graceful, well rounded, healthy girl, and
would escape much of the weakness and suffering
so common to women.</p>

<p>Herbert Spencer, speaking of the effects of the
intellectual cramming system upon the women in
England, and of the disadvantages of neglecting
physical culture, says: “On women the effects of
this forcing system are, if possible, even more injurious
than on men. Being in a great measure
debarred from those vigorous and enjoyable exercises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of the body by which boys mitigate the
evils of excessive study, girls feel these evils in their
full intensity. Mothers, anxious to make their
daughters attractive, could scarcely choose a course
more fatal than this which sacrifices the body to
the mind. Either they disregard the tastes of the
opposite sex, or else their conception of those tastes
is erroneous. Men care comparatively little for
erudition in women, but very much for physical
beauty and good nature and sound sense.”</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Symmetrical Development of Women.</b>&mdash;The
common argument of the busy housewife, when
urged to take exercise, is, that she gets enough of
it in the course of her daily duties, and even more
than enough, for she finds herself thoroughly exhausted
by the necessary labors of the day. The
argument is not so convincing as it might seem.
Doubtless, some of her muscles are overtaxed.
They lack the support which the idle muscles should
give. A few minutes, several times a day, devoted
to strengthening the unused muscles, would not
only afford relaxation to the tired ones, but, by
developing the general strength, would prevent
fatigue on the part of those most used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Amount of Exercise Necessary for Women.</b>&mdash;The
amount of daily exercise necessary to regain
health and develop strength depends upon the
woman’s present condition. If she is weak, generally,
the exercise for the first fortnight, while
comprehensive enough to bring all the muscles into
play, must be light and easy. As strength is gained,
the exercise may be gradually increased. As soon
as a sufficient basis of vigor is reached, the essential
thing to do is to adapt the exercise mainly to the
weaker muscles so that they may catch up.</p>

<p>The right arm is usually stronger than the left.
For the first month or two, give the left arm nearly
all the exercise, gradually increasing the amount
until it is able to do its share equally with the
right. If the chest is small and the muscles of the
back are weak, select the exercise specially suited
to the case. The greatest care must be taken not
to overdo the matter. For two or three weeks, only
the mildest form of exercise should be employed,
but the drill must be persistently kept up and gradually
increased in difficulty. If the instruction or
counsel of a specialist can be obtained, it would be
well to secure it. If not, the wide range of valuable
exercises given in this volume will be helpful in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
selecting and practicing those best adapted to the
individual case.</p>

<p>If her work is of a sedentary or confining kind,
there is the greater need of special exercise. Such
work demands a strong constitution, and many break
down under it annually. If long hours in shop, or
store, or office are required of her, still it will be
possible to find some time for exercise. Five or
ten minutes may be secured upon rising in the
morning. Clad in a loose robe, throw up the window
and engage in vigorous, free hand gymnastics
to expand the chest, increase the respiration, stimulate
the circulation, and afford a healthy exhilaration
to the muscles. After breakfast, walk to the
place of business, or, if the distance be too great,
walk part of the way. At noon, from five to ten
minutes can again be secured for a breath of fresh
air and a little exercise. A brisk walk with a cheerful
companion will banish the dull routine of labor,
and impart new energy for the duties of the afternoon.
Even without the companion, the freer respiration
induced by the walk, together with change
of scene and thought, will prove beneficial.</p>

<p>In the middle of the forenoon, and again in the
afternoon, three minutes can be found in which to
stretch the cramped muscles and relieve the weary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
back. Stand erect, and with hands on hips and
shoulders thrown back, take four or five full inhalations.
Throw the hands over the head, and
stretch them towards the ceiling, at the same time
raise the heels, stand on the toes for a few seconds,
and repeat about five times. This simple exercise,
which need not occupy more than three minutes, will
impart new energy, and result in the accomplishment
of more work.</p>

<p>If an evening walk cannot be had every day, at
least three or four might be enjoyed in a week,
and would be productive of untold benefit. Let the
motion be energetic and the step elastic. The distance
should be moderate at first, and gradually increased.
To this should be added five to ten minutes’
exercise for the arms and chest before retiring.</p>

<p>This simple programme, involving no expense for
apparatus, and requiring only so much time as even
the busiest of men or women can find, will, in a
short time, if persistently pursued, improve the
digestion, stimulate the circulation, banish sleeplessness,
transform dullness into cheerfulness, prevent
weakness, impart tone and vigor to the nervous
as well as to the muscular system, and contribute
largely to the prolongation of a life of happiness
and success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Women of Leisure.</b>&mdash;The daughters of wealthy
or well-to-do parents and the wives of prosperous
husbands should be the healthiest and happiest of
women. Between graduation day and the wedding
day, the young woman is frequently a lady of leisure.
At least, she can usually control her time, and
secure an hour or more each day for those healthful
recreations which will fortify her against the various
forms of physical weakness that are so common
among women.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Out-Door Exercises.</b>&mdash;Being free to enjoy the
many out-door exercises, she should spend much
time in the open air, making such choice of games
and recreations as will bring into play the largest
number of muscles, and afford the best all-round
development, having in view, not only the securing
of health and strength, but also the acquisition of
grace and beauty.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Gymnasiums.</b>&mdash;If a capable instructor and a
gymnasium are at hand, she should avail herself of
both. Supplementing her out-door sports with
these, she will, in a year’s time, unless already afflicted
with some organic ailment or serious constitutional
weakness, be so healthy, strong, and well
developed, as to give promise of a long life, free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
from the infirmities that so commonly affect the
sex.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Occupations of Men.</b>&mdash;The vital statistics, preserved
by many progressive states and communities,
afford opportunity for fruitful study and comparison.
Of all occupations, that of the farmer or
gardener conduces most to health and long life.
His independent manner of living, the pure country
air he breathes, the abundant sunshine he enjoys,
the plain, wholesome food he eats, his restful,
quiet sleep, and his freedom from the demands
of fashionable life, all combine to give him health.
But this occupation, in itself, probably brings into
play a larger number of muscles than any other
single employment.</p>

<p>We cannot all be farmers, but whatever our occupation,
there is much we can do to promote
health, and to secure that happiness which is so
largely dependent thereon. Many occupations afford
exercise to a limited number of muscles, and
those engaged therein should strive to find their
recreation in the exercise of other muscles, so as to
promote a well-rounded development. Persons who
labor in-doors, and especially those who are confined
to close workshops, stores, and schoolrooms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
should have out-door recreation, with pure air and
sunshine.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Unbalanced Bodies.</b>&mdash;Many lines of mechanical
trade afford sufficient exercise to keep the workman
in fairly good health, yet few, if any, give a
symmetrical physical development. The blacksmith
and stone mason usually have strong right
hands and arms, while the left are less fully developed.
Nine-tenths of all machinists are right-handed.
In nearly all mechanical industries, the
right arm and the back have the larger share of
the work, while the chest and leg muscles and the
left arm are neglected.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Indifference.</b>&mdash;Some workmen are so indifferent
to physical symmetry that they are not willing to
do anything to avert the one-sidedness resulting
from their daily toil, even when convinced that a
slight effort would correct the fault. The argument
of increased health and vigor, and prolonged life,
scarcely appeals to them.</p>

<p>Few persons are ambidextrous. Many more
might use the hands with equal skill, if they would.
Even so simple an operation as putting on a coat,
using the wrong arm first, or buttoning a vest with
the other hand, is awkward for most persons, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
quite difficult to many. The best time to begin is
in childhood, but, even if, when first learning the
use of tools, the left hand is often made to do the
work of the right, the exchange will prove restful
to the overworked hand, and the symmetrical development
of both sides of the body will be preserved.</p>

<p>A skillful teacher of music, in a private school
near Philadelphia, suffered a partial paralysis of
his right arm, which prevented its use for several
years. This necessitated the increased use of the
left hand, which resulted in its increased skill and
power. Several years later, he removed to the
South, where the warmer climate gradually restored
the use of the right arm. By this time, the
left hand had become almost as skillful as the right
had been, and the severe affliction proved to be a
blessing in disguise.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Brain Workers.</b>&mdash;The brain workers are usually
men of sedentary habits. To no class is exercise
so important. Without it, some part of the
human machinery is almost certain to get out of
order. It may be the stomach or lungs, the liver
or kidneys, the head, or eyes, or throat. There is
a lack of perfect action of one or more of the parts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
a clogging of the organs of digestion, or circulation,
or respiration. This physical clogging at once
affects the mental work, dulling the thinking
powers, and often rendering their efforts futile,
and making the complete cessation of labor necessary.</p>

<p>Headaches and indigestion are among the first
ailments resulting from a lack of exercise. A brisk
walk of twenty minutes or half an hour is often
sufficient to dispel a headache. The exercise flushes
the parts most actively engaged, and so depletes
the brain. The same exercise stimulates the action
of the lungs, makes better blood, quickens the
activity of the other organs, and so tones up the
whole man.</p>

<p>A young man, whose Christian zeal prompted
him to devote all his spare time to religious work,
ignoring the demands of health, broke down, and
after a prolonged sickness, followed by a slow and
tedious convalescence, was heard to remark, “Well,
this experience has taught me one thing; the Lord
has no use for a sick man.” Had this young man
taken a reasonable amount of exercise, he would
have lost no time from his business, would have
accomplished vastly more work for the religious
organizations to which he belonged, and would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
saved himself the pain, suffering, and expense of
his sickness.</p>

<p>If the man who has eight or ten hours of busy
brain work in-doors daily, and who, when his duties
are ended, has no heart for physical exercise,
would, every hour or two, turn aside from his work,
and take even two minutes’ vigorous exercise, in
his office or in the adjoining hallway, he would return
to his labor with brain considerably refreshed,
and at the close of the day, he would enter upon his
half hour’s walk with spirit and alacrity, and welcome
his sleep at the end of the day.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Business Men.</b>&mdash;Who does not know, among
his business acquaintances, men whose faces show
that they are continually overworked? They have
no time for systematic physical exercise, but go
dragging through their duties as well as their low
physical condition and tired brains will permit.
The noonday lunch is bolted, or is omitted entirely,
for want of time.</p>

<p>Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, a specialist in nervous disorders,
speaks of the numerous instances of nervous
exhaustion among merchants and manufacturers.
He says: “My note books seem to show that manufacturers
and certain classes of railway officials are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the most liable to suffer from neural exhaustion.
Next to these come merchants in general, brokers,
etc.; then, less frequently, clergymen; still less
often, lawyers; and, more rarely, doctors; while distressing
cases are apt to occur among the over-schooled
young of both sexes.”</p>

<p>Few business or professional men do anything to
secure and preserve health and strength, and they
go through life far less efficient and useful than
they might be.</p>

<p>Pre-eminent business success can be achieved
only by turning over to subordinates the numerous
details which occupy so much time, and which any
trustworthy and experienced secretary or assistant
might do. By this arrangement, time would be
saved for necessary recreation and rest, thus keeping
the physical systems of the employers and managers
in the best possible condition, and securing
to the mind that alertness and vigor which the sharp
competition of the times demands.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Professional Men.</b>&mdash;Looking over a list of eminent
divines, it is surprising how many of them
were men of rugged frames and sturdy physique.
It required a man with the physical vigor of Luther
to declare he would attend the Diet of Worms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
“though the devils there were as numerous as the
tiles on the houses.” How much of the success of
Spurgeon, and Beecher, and Dr. John Hall may
be fairly ascribed to their splendid outfit of vital
organs, and to the glowing health which each enjoyed.
Nor were Phillips Brooks, and Joseph
Cook, and Dwight L. Moody lacking in these
physical qualities which count for so much in influencing
the minds and hearts of men. These
knew nothing of “blue Mondays” or “ministers’
sore throat,” and needed not to be sent abroad by
their congregations, every summer or two, in order
to recruit their health, and keep them up to their
work.</p>

<p>By virtue of his profession and because of its
onerous and responsible duties, no one stands more
in need of robust health than the physician. Called
from his bed at all hours of the night, brought in
daily contact with disease, and that often of a contagious
character, the largest demands are made
upon his vital forces. He is expected, not only to
dispense the necessary medicines, but also to carry
comfort and cheer to the bedside of the sick. The
very countenance of a healthy, cheerful physician
acts like a medicine.</p>

<p>The country practitioner who rides or drives long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
distances, over rough roads, and who often attends
to his horse himself, needs but little further exercise,
and that little should be applied to the least-used
muscles, in order to preserve a well-rounded
development. The city physician, whose coachman
relieves him of the exercise of driving and of the
care of the horses, will find a half hour daily, with
pulley-weights, clubs, or dumb-bells, and an occasional
visit to a gymnasium conducive to his
best physical condition. As a dentist should himself
have the best of teeth, the doctor also should
enjoy the most robust health.</p>

<p>And what of the legal profession? Rufus Choate
inherited a strong, healthy body, but took so little
care of it, that, towards the close of his life, he was
accustomed to say of himself that “latterly he had
worn out his constitution, and was living on the
by-laws.” He died at fifty-five, while his contemporary,
Daniel Webster, who appreciated the
importance of keeping his body well toned-up, and
who, with fishing rod in hand, found recreation
among the streams of his native State, preserved
his robust physique and imperial bearing to the
allotted three score and ten. Lord Brougham, as a
boy, was the swiftest runner in his neighborhood.
His physical strength and endurance were such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
that upon one occasion he spoke in Parliament
seven days consecutively. He kept up his activity
to the end of his life, and died at the age of eighty-nine.</p>

<p>President Eliot, of Harvard College, who has
enjoyed exceptional opportunities for observing the
effects of exercise upon young men, says: “A
singular notion prevails, especially in the country,
that it is the feeble, sickly children who should be
sent to school and college, since they are apparently
unfit for hard work. The fact that, in the history
of literature, a few cases can be pointed out in
which genius was lodged in a weak or diseased
body, is sometimes adduced in support of the strange
proposition that physical vigor is not necessary
for professional men. But all experience contradicts
these notions. To attain success and length
of service in any of the learned professions, a vigorous
body is well-nigh essential. A busy lawyer,
editor, minister, physician, or teacher has need of
greater physical endurance than a farmer, trader,
manufacturer, or mechanic. All professional biography
teaches that to win lasting distinction in
sedentary, in-door occupations, which task the brain
and the nervous system, extraordinary toughness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
body must accompany extraordinary mental
powers.”</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Heredity.</b>&mdash;In the matter of bodily health and
vigor, the sins of the parents are visited upon the
children. What narrow-mindedness the father displays,
therefore, in devoting himself so assiduously
to business as to neglect his health, and to entail
upon his sons and daughters such a low standard
of vitality as to impair their usefulness in life, and
to deprive them of the power to enjoy, as they
should, the inheritance he hopes to leave them.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Exercise for the Stout, the Thin, and the Old.</b>&mdash;It
may seem somewhat paradoxical that the same
means that are employed to increase flesh and
weight should also be recommended to reduce
obesity. There is a difference, however, between
superfluous fat and solid, healthy, active muscle.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Stout.</b>&mdash;It is a well known fact that persons
of moderate weight, in preparing for some unusual
or extraordinary test of strength, reduce their
flesh and toughen their muscles by a course of
severe training. It is not an uncommon thing for
college crews to reduce their weights, by a month’s
training, twelve pounds per man. A prize fighter
will often come down thirty or forty pounds in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
preparing for a contest. An instance is cited of a
student, who, after carefully weighing himself, sat
down to a fifty-five pound rowing-weight, pulled
forty-five full strokes a minute for twenty minutes,
then, with the same clothing as before, weighed
himself, and found he had lost one pound.</p>

<p>Many men, and women, too, if persuaded that
there was, at hand, a convenient and comparatively
easy method of ridding themselves of their burden
of flesh, would doubtless avail themselves of it.
The following well authenticated cases may be suggestive
and helpful. A young lady, inclined to
fleshiness, by vigorous horseback riding, reduced
her weight twenty-five pounds in one year. A
policeman, whose weight was three hundred and
fifteen pounds, took a position as stoker on a war
vessel. The exercise, coupled with the free perspiration
induced by labor in the heated quarters,
lowered his weight to one hundred and eighty-four
pounds. A man in middle life, whose occupation
was a sedentary one, and whose weight, over three
hundred pounds, was a source of great discomfort,
resolved to try what exercise would do. Being
much engrossed through the day, he began by taking
long, brisk walks in the evening. Soon he was
able to cover five miles at a fairly good pace. Whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the state of the weather, and however tired he
might be with the day’s exacting duties, he suffered
nothing to interfere with his evening walk. He
gradually increased the pace and the distance, and,
with little or no change in his diet, in five months
he had taken off ninety pounds. He says that he
often perspired so freely that, in cold weather,
small icicles were formed on the ends of his hair.
Free perspiration is a necessary element in the rapid
reduction of flesh. The fat-producing foods should
be avoided as far as possible.</p>

<p>While exercise is one of the best means of reducing
superfluous fat, there is no class of persons
more loath to take exercise than the obese. The
reasons are largely physiological. The greater
weight is a burden to carry. The muscular tissues
have in part changed to fat, and are therefore less
able to do their work. The action of the lungs and
the heart is interfered with by the pressure of the
fat, and the individual quickly becomes exhausted
and short of breath. There is the greater demand,
therefore, on the part of those who incline to
obesity, to exercise with determined persistency and
regularity, in order to reduce their weight. Exercises
involving quickness of movement, and a degree
of mental activity, are the best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Thin.</b>&mdash;The old proverb says: “It is a
poor rule that will not work both ways.” Judged
by this standard, the rule of exercise must be a
good one, for the instances of lean arms and legs
filled out, and of scrawny necks and hollow shoulders
made round and plump by exercise, outnumber
the other ten to one.</p>

<p>Many lean persons, impressed with the apparent
discomfort and inconvenience of obesity, are content
with their slender measure of flesh. This is
especially true of men, who, as a rule, have less
regard for beauty of form than those of the other
sex. They overlook the fact that the man whose
bony structure is well overlaid with thick layers of
healthy muscular tissue is able not only to accomplish
more work, but to stand greater exposure
and endure more hardships than the lean man.
His stronger, heavier muscles will not only carry
his greater weight with less effort, but his larger
body will possess a momentum that the other man
does not have.</p>

<p>In the severe training preceding the inter-collegiate
boat races, while the over fleshy lose their
superfluous fat, the thin gain as rapidly in weight.
Many lean people whose occupations are of a physical
nature do too much, daily, in proportion to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
their strength. Mind and body are kept in such
a constant state of activity that their energies become
exhausted. If such persons will take an occasional
rest through the day, when it is possible
so to do, and will add an hour or more to the period
of sleep, their weight will soon begin to increase.
Then, by special exercises aimed at the weak points,
and persistently sustained, the gain in weight will
be that of solid, healthy, muscular tissue, which will
not only fill out their leanness, but will give them
power to do more work with less fatigue.</p>

<p>A short rest after meals, with the practice of deep
abdominal breathing, begun, if need be, as a special
drill, but ultimately established as a habit, will go
far toward improving the digestion and converting
the food into good, healthy blood, so indispensable
to the growth of every part of the human body.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Exercises for Gouty and Rheumatic Persons.</b>&mdash;Gout
and other uric acid conditions, whether
hereditary or acquired, frequently yield to systematic
physical exercises. These conditions are generally
the result of indigestion or overfeeding. By
exercise, more oxygen is brought into the circulation
of the blood, and the chemical process is promoted.
By free perspiration, the action of the skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
is stimulated, and the work of the kidneys is lightened.
In the case of those afflicted with gout, special
care is needed for a time. A mild form of exercise
should be employed at first, and gradually increased.
A free perspiration should be induced
daily, followed by a bath and vigorous rubbing.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Exercises for the Dyspeptic.</b>&mdash;If the system
has become much weakened by dyspepsia or indigestion,
begin with mild forms of exercise&mdash;walking,
bicycling, golf, and other out-door sports. For
a lack of tone of the abdominal muscles, swimming
in warm weather is found useful. The in-door tank
is not quite so good as the stream or surf. If the
liver is chiefly at fault, horseback riding is a capital
remedy. Gradually introduce more vigorous exercises.
Daily bathing and rubbing must not be neglected.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Exercises for the Development of Special
Muscles.</b>&mdash;Few persons, even among those who
have given considerable attention to physical culture
and have spent much time in a gymnasium, could,
if asked, tell what special forms of exercise were
best calculated to fill out a hollow shoulder or flat
chest, or strengthen weak loins or back. The following
suggestions will therefore prove helpful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>The different muscles of the human body are so
closely interwoven that it is impossible to exercise
one without, at the same time, giving exercise to
another lying contiguous to or co-operating with it.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Chest.</b>&mdash;While it is important that all the
muscles of the body should be exercised, those that
are most closely allied to the vital functions of
respiration, circulation, and digestion claim the first
consideration.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Breathing Exercises.</b>&mdash;For the purpose of chest
expansion, nothing can take the place of regular
breathing exercises. While respiration is an involuntary
act, yet the manner is, to some extent, subject
to the control of the will. There are three commonly
recognized forms of breathing&mdash;the clavicular,
the costal, and the abdominal. These are not
wholly independent, but overlap each other.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Clavicular Breathing.</b>&mdash;Place the palms of the
hands on the chest, with the tip of the middle finger
resting on the clavicle, or collar bone. Inhale
slowly, directing the breath toward the upper chest.
Hold the breath a few seconds, then exhale slowly.
Repeat ten to fifty times.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Costal Breathing.</b>&mdash;This is a fuller and better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
form of breathing than the clavicular. The lower
ribs are more flexible than the upper, and, supplemented
by the action of the intercostal muscles,
admit of freer movement of the lungs. Press the
hands against the sides. Inhale through the nose,
and inflate the lungs to the fullest. Hold the breath
as long as convenient. Exhale forcibly through the
open mouth. Repeat five to ten times. Repeat, exhaling
slowly through the nostrils. Repeat, exhaling
through a small glass or other tube, with an
aperture about the size of an ordinary knitting
needle. While the lungs are inflated, strike the
chest gently with closed hands. This will drive the
air into the remotest cells. With the lungs filled,
and the arms akimbo, bend the body at the waist,
forwards, backwards, and from side to side, and return
to erect position before exhaling.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Abdominal Breathing.</b>&mdash;This is the best method
of breathing, and should be cultivated by all.
Singers and speakers find in this the fulcrum of
their vocal power. The contraction and expansion
of the diaphragm, that wonderful muscular partition,
which separates the thoracic from the abdominal
cavity, affords the largest and freest movement
of the lungs, and, by its pressure upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
viscera, repeated with every breath, it aids greatly
in promoting digestion. Many persons, especially
women, do not employ abdominal breathing to the
extent they should. Some, indeed, hardly know its
meaning.</p>

<p>Upon retiring at night, remove all constricting
bands about the waist, lie upon the back, and rest
the hands upon the abdomen. Direct the breath so
as to raise the hands. Fill the lungs full as possible,
and hold the breath for several seconds. Exhale,
letting the hands fall with the outgoing breath.
Take two or three ordinary breaths, then repeat,
drawing in the breath slowly through the nostrils,
lock in the breath for a few seconds, and exhale
slowly as before. A better position of the body
would probably be secured by folding a comfortable,
spreading it upon the floor, and lying flat upon the
back. Heavy pillows and yielding bed-springs
crook the body, and often prevent the best results.
The abdominal movement, in breathing, is not quite
so apparent when standing or sitting, but if the exercise
be taken as frequently as possible, with the
mind directed to the freest diaphragmatic movement,
the habit of full, deep, abdominal breathing,
with its numerous attendant advantages, will soon
become established.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Chest Muscles.</b>&mdash;Not only should the lung cavity
be enlarged by breathing exercises, and by any
physical exercise that stimulates respiration, as
steady and protracted running, but the front chest
should be well covered by the pectoral muscles.
With the arms at right angles to the body, and with
head thrown back, so as to face the ceiling, raise
and lower the dumb-bells from twelve to eighteen
inches. As strength increases, increase the weight
of the bells and the number of lifts. Swinging with
the hands upon the horizontal bar is another good
exercise. The “dips” exercise, elsewhere referred
to, is also good for the pectorals, but must not be
attempted until after strength has been gained by
lighter exercises. The relation of the biceps and
triceps to the pectoral muscles is so close that any
exercise for the former will be helpful to the latter.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Respiratory Exercise, No. 1.</b>&mdash;With arms at
sides and elbows stiff, raise the hands as high as
possible above the head. Rise upon the toes at the
same time, so as to give the body the longest possible
upward reach. Inhale slowly through the nostrils
while the arms ascend, and hold the breath a
moment or two, then exhale, lower the arms, and
rest back upon the heels. Repeat ten to twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
times. It is needless to say that in the in-door exercises,
and especially in the breathing exercises and
those which stimulate respiration, the room should
be well ventilated. The head and neck should be
held erect, except where a different position is required.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Respiratory Exercise, No. 2.</b>&mdash;Lie flat upon the
floor, face downward, hands folded upon the back.
Inflate the lungs and lift the head and shoulders
as high as possible, giving out the breath slowly.
Repeat several times, and as strength increases,
oftener.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Abdominal Exercise, No. 1.</b>&mdash;Several good exercises
for the abdominal muscles are here given,
which can be taken upon rising in the morning and
upon retiring at night. With just enough clothing
to keep the body from chilling, lie flat on the back
upon a folded comfortable spread upon the floor.
Without bending the knee, raise the foot toward
the ceiling as far as possible, then the other foot,
so alternating ten times or oftener. Next raise both
feet together. While these movements should be
brisk, the limbs should not be allowed to drop back
upon the floor, but the muscles should be kept tense.
Next, from the vertical position of the leg, bend the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
knee and press it closely upon the abdomen for a
moment, then restore to the vertical position and
lower to the floor. Alternate the limbs as before,
then take them together.</p>

<p>By means of a loop, or other simple arrangement,
to keep the feet from rising, lift the head and trunk
to a vertical position by contracting the abdominal
muscles. This is a severe exercise, and should not
be attempted by those who have any special abdominal
weakness. The strain may be relieved,
however, by propping the head and shoulders with
pillows, so as to make, with the lower limbs, an
angle of about forty-five degrees. Gradually, as the
abdominal muscles increase in strength, take out
one pillow after another, until able to raise the
body from the horizontal position. The latter exercise
may be still further graduated by first resting
the arms at the sides; next cross them on the chest,
and then clasp the hands behind the neck before
lifting the trunk. In gymnasiums it is not an uncommon
thing to see a person with well developed
abdominal muscles lift another person lying prostrate
across his chest, and weighing anywhere from
one hundred and fifty to two hundred pounds, by
the sheer force of these muscles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Abdominal Exercise, No. 2.</b>&mdash;Sit on a bench or
stool, and with feet under a couch, or hooked into
a strap fastened to the base-board of the room, with
arms folded upon the chest, bend forward and
backward, as far as possible, without strain. Repeat
ten to twenty times. After a few weeks, increase
the bend.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Abdominal, Side, and Back Muscles.</b>&mdash;Stand
erect with hands on hips. Keep head, neck, and legs
rigid, and lungs well filled. Bend slowly backward
and forward several times. Bend from side to side.
With feet firmly planted, bend forward, and revolve
the head and trunk to the right, back, left,
front, and assume an erect position. Bend forward
again, and reverse the order of movement. Repeat
several times. Next, stand erect, with hands
firmly planted on hips, and twist the body from the
waist upward, first to the right as far as possible,
then to the left, and repeat ten to twenty times.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Loins.</b>&mdash;The muscles in the small of the
back, running up and down on each side of the
spine, come into play in many forms of manual
labor, and should therefore possess strength and
endurance. Working with the shovel, or fork, or
bar, or saw, or any exercise requiring a stooping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
posture, brings them into action. Several of the
exercises recommended for the abdominal muscles
will prove of advantage here. Raising dumb-bells
above the head, first with the left hand, then with
the right, then with both, beginning with bells
weighing a pound or two, and each month, with
daily practice, adding a pound to the weight until
it reaches about one-twentieth the weight of the
person, will bring the desired results. Running or
rapid walking, with the body erect, will prove helpful.
Hopping straight ahead for from five to ten
steps on one foot, then on the other, and thus alternating
for from twenty to one hundred steps, or
more, will soon beget strength, and give a firm,
steady carriage.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Back.</b>&mdash;The muscles of the back, above the
waist line, participate in nearly all the movements
recommended for the chest, shoulders, and upper
arm, and do not require special exercises.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Shoulders.</b>&mdash;To round out hollow shoulders
and put muscle on the upper back, stand erect,
with light dumb-bells, arms hanging at the sides.
Without bending the elbow, keep the arms parallel,
and carry the bells backward and forward as far
as possible. Hold for a few moments, and slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
return to the sides. Repeat five to ten times. As
strength increases, gradually add to the weight of
the bells and the number of lifts, also endeavor to
carry the arms a trifle higher. For developing the
muscles of the shoulders, back, and wrist, few exercises
are better than light Indian-clubs.</p>

<p>For the outside of the shoulder, bring the arms
to the horizontal, elbows rigid, and move the bells
up and down through a space of twenty inches.
Repeat five to ten times. Carry to the front and
repeat. A few weeks of daily practice should show
noticeable results, and a year of persistent drill will
produce a shapely shoulder, and make it unnecessary
for the tailor to pad the coat in order to make
it fit.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Neck.</b>&mdash;The muscles of the neck may best
be developed by the use of a strong rubber strap,
about two feet long. Attach one end to the door
frame, about the height of the head when standing,
and fasten the other end to a band which loosely
encircles the head. The front, back, and sides of
the neck may all be strengthened and filled out with
firm, shapely muscles, by changing the position of
the body for each change of exercise desired. Keep
the head firm to resist the pull of the strap. Increase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the length of the movement and the strength
of the pull, as the muscles grow strong to bear it.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Upper Arm.</b>&mdash;The biceps is the large front
muscle of the upper arm. It bends the arm and
brings the hand toward the shoulder. A large biceps
is the envy of many young men who regard it
as the criterion of physical strength, and who often
develop it out of all proportion to the rest of the
body. It is, however, an important muscle, and
should receive due consideration. Most persons
will find that one arm or one leg or one side is
weaker than the other. Give to the weaker member
much the larger practice until the equilibrium
is restored, then exercise them equally.</p>

<p>With dumb-bells, flat-irons, window-weights, or
other objects in hand, slowly bend the arm until the
hand almost touches the shoulder, then slowly lower
to position. Repeat ten to twenty times. Gradually
increase the weight and the number of lifts. If
pulley-weights are used, stand so that the outstretched
hand barely reaches the handle of the rope.
With palms upward, draw the hand toward the
shoulder. Slowly relax and repeat.</p>

<p>When away from home, and having no access to
anything that may serve as apparatus, in this, as
in many exercises, one arm may serve as lever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and the other as weight. With the right hand,
grasp firmly the wrist of the left. Press down
vigorously with the left, but use enough force to
overcome the resistance, and with the right raise
it to the shoulder. After several repetitions, reverse
the hands.</p>

<p>Some persons ignore the use of all apparatus,
preferring what is known as free gymnastics. This
extreme is greatly to be preferred to that of using
heavy, and often dangerous, appliances. In many
exercises, the weight of the body or its parts affords
sufficient resistance to develop the muscles.
In other cases, the imagination supplies the want of
resistance, and, by due concentration of will, making
one set of muscles pull against another, the
muscles may be given as much work as though
actual weight were present. To children and young
persons, light and suitable apparatus will furnish
added stimulus and interest.</p>

<p>Climbing a ladder or rope, hand over hand, or
lifting the body so that the chin may touch a horizontal
bar overhead, are exercises better suited to
later stages of biceps development. To be able to
lift the body to the bar with one hand, three to five
times, should satisfy any reasonable ambition.</p>

<p>The triceps are the back and inside muscles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the upper arm, and contribute much to the shapeliness
as well as usefulness of that member. Instead
of stopping at the shoulder, as in the biceps exercises,
push the dumb-bells high overhead. Any exercise
of pushing with the arms is of advantage.
Stand back about two feet from the door, grasp the
sides of the frame a trifle higher than the shoulders,
and, rising on the toes, with head erect, thrust the
body forward. Press back until the body again
assumes an erect attitude, and repeat ten to twenty
times.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Forearm.</b>&mdash;Many of the exercises for the
upper arm and shoulder have a very direct bearing
upon the forearm. Most of the mechanical occupations
requiring the use of axe, saw, plane, hammer,
shovel, plow, or any tool or instrument requiring
a firm grasp of the hand, develop these muscles.
The lifting of a heavy weight suspended from a
bar or handle, to be grasped by the hands, produces
speedy results, but must not be attempted
until the muscles of the back, abdomen, and shoulders
have had preparatory training.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Hand.</b>&mdash;In the exercises already described,
the hand and wrist will have received much valuable
training for strength of hold or grip. A firm grasp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of the oar, the bat, the bar, or the heavy hammer
is apt to leave the hand with an ungainly hook
when at rest. Counteract by pressing the fingers
forcibly against the wall, or, in lifting the body
from the floor in the triceps exercise, use only the
fingers and thumbs instead of the palm. The wrists
may be exercised by twisting the dumb-bells at
arm’s length in front, at the side, and overhead.</p>

<p>If the fingers are weak, train them individually,
beginning with the weakest. Always bring up the
weakest part first, and aim to secure and preserve
proper symmetry throughout. The pulley-weights
are excellent for the purpose. Attach a small strap
to the handle, and begin with such weight as will
afford exercise but will not overtax the finger. Pull
ten to thirty times. In the absence of pulley-weights,
lifting, by a strap, a box of sand or bricks
or any weight that can be gradually increased will
serve the purpose. Drive a stout nail or screw into
the upper part of the door frame. Throw the strap
over the nail, and lift the body, first using two
fingers, then one. Trained gymnasts lift the entire
weight of the body several times by the little
finger alone.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Thigh.</b>&mdash;Fast walking, running, jumping,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
hopping, skating, and dancing are all good for developing
the front of the thigh. More rapid development
will be secured by standing erect, slowly
bending the knees as if about to sit in a chair. Hold
the body in that position for several moments, and
slowly rise to an erect posture. Repeat ten to
twenty times. After two weeks of daily practice,
lower the body until the back part of the thigh rests
on the calf. Rise slowly as before. Repeat ten to
twenty times. After a month, increase the weight
by carrying dumb-bells, bricks, or other objects in
the hands. When this has become easy, hold one
foot front or back, and have the other leg do the
lifting.</p>

<p>The under part of the thigh, in the ordinary occupations
and recreations of life, does not get as much
exercise as the front muscles. A slovenly, shambling
gait is characterized by a feebleness of this
muscle, while a strong, elastic step is accompanied
by a well developed under thigh. With knees unbent,
stoop over and try to touch the floor with the
fingers, making five or ten thrusts before assuming
an erect attitude. Walking or jumping up and
down on a plank elevated at an angle of forty-five
or fifty degrees with the floor, with the toes toward
the higher end, is a good exercise for the calves and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the under thigh. Stand on one foot, weight the
other, and swing it backward and forward as high
as possible.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Calf.</b>&mdash;Climbing up hill, running on the
toes, hopping long distances on one foot-any one
of them, if persistently followed, will, in a short
time, result in strengthening the calf and increasing
its size. Professor Maclaren declares that in four
months of Alpine climbing his calves increased
from sixteen inches to seventeen and one-quarter,
and his thighs from twenty-three and one-half
inches to twenty-five.</p>

<p>Another exercise, very simple, has been found
productive of great good. Stand erect, chest out,
shoulders down, knees stiff, feet slightly apart, toes
turned outward. Raise the heels as high as possible,
throwing the weight of the body upon the toes.
Repeat at the rate of fifty to seventy times a minute.
One minute’s work will prove sufficient for the exercise.
Increase to two, three, or four minutes a
day for a month. A gentleman, approaching middle
life, who was not satisfied with a calf that
girthed fourteen and one-quarter inches, in four
months, by this exercise, added another inch. He
devoted fifteen minutes to it, morning and evening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and after a time carried a twelve pound weight in
each hand.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Pulley-Weight.</b>&mdash;The uses of the pulley-weight
are so numerous and so varied that it constitutes almost
a complete gymnasium in itself. One of its
prime advantages is, that by gradually multiplying
the number of weights, it adapts itself nicely to the
increasing strength of the individual, and to the
varying powers of the different members of the
family. It reaches directly every muscle of the
hand, wrist, arm, shoulder, chest, abdomen, back,
and neck. By the use of an extra pulley near the
floor, necessitating a longer rope, excellent drill
of the leg muscles is afforded. By sitting on the
floor, the latter arrangement is converted into a
rowing machine, affording exercise for the arms,
back, and legs.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Dumb-Bells.</b>&mdash;These are less expensive but
scarcely less valuable than the pulley-weight in the
scope and variety of the exercises they afford. They
may be of wood or iron, and should not be heavy.
For the average person, one and one-half pounds,
each, is a good weight. For children, one pound is
sufficient.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>A Home-Made Gymnasium.</b>&mdash;By a home-made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
gymnasium is meant the use of such appliances as
the ordinary home will furnish, or as a person, with
a little mechanical skill, can supply.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Chair Exercises.</b>&mdash;A light chair, grasped firmly
by the outer upright supports of the back, with the
two hands, and swung vigorously around the head
ten to twenty times, first in one direction, then in
the other, will afford one of the best simple exercises
known. It brings into play the muscles of the
hands, arms, legs, and many parts of the body, and
if repeated at short intervals will not only increase
the respiration and stimulate the circulation, but
will also start the perspiration. The intervals should
be occupied with exercises that bring into play other
muscles, as rising on the toes, stretching the legs,
breathing exercises, etc.</p>

<p>Another valuable chair exercise consists in placing
two chairs, front to front or side to side, with
a space between them of about six inches more than
the width of the body. Place the hands flat on the
chairs, then slip the feet back, and with the toes
resting on the floor and the limbs and body rigid,
lower and raise the body several times. For deepening
the chest and strengthening the arms and
shoulders, this will be found an excellent exercise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Unless the chair feet are spread, care must be taken
to place the hands well within the edge of the seat,
to prevent the chairs from tipping over. One chair
may be used instead of two, by grasping the sides of
the seat firmly and bringing the chest nearly or
quite to the front of the seat.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Door-Jamb Exercise, No. 1.</b>&mdash;A light form of
chest and arm exercise may be had by grasping
the side jambs of a door-frame, about as high as the
shoulders, and planting the feet a short distance
back. Keep the lower limbs and trunk rigid, the
head thrown well back, and thrust the body backward
and forward from ten to twenty times.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Door-Jamb Exercise, No. 2.</b>&mdash;For those having
weak chests and weak arms there is no better exercise
than that known as the “dips,” for which the
parallel bars of the regular gymnasium are largely
used. An excellent substitute for the bars may be
made by boring a hole about two inches in diameter
into each side of the door-frame, about waist high,
and fitting to each hole a strong wooden handle or
peg. These should project into the doorway with
a space of eighteen to twenty inches between their
inner ends in which to stand. The exercise consists
in placing the hands on the pegs, and slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
raising and lowering the body a number of times
by the muscles of the arms alone. At first, some
assistance from the toes may be necessary. Soon
the arms will be able to do the work alone. Beginning
with five lifts, the number may be gradually
increased to fifty. It is understood that the pegs
may be removed when not in use.</p>

<p>If the disfigurement of the door-frame between
two rooms, or room and hallway, is a serious objection,
the jambs of a roomy closet door may be
used, in which case the closing of the door shuts
the holes from sight. Two high tables, or a foot
rail of a bed and a table, or box placed firmly upon
two chairs&mdash;in short, any two pieces that will afford
a lift of the body, such as that described, will serve
the purpose nearly as well.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Door-Jamb Exercise, No. 3.</b>&mdash;By fastening two
cleats or supports on the inner faces of the door-frame,
with a niche or slot in each, to support a
horizontal bar, extending across the doorway near
the top, just within reach, a simple but very valuable
piece of apparatus is ready for use. For
strengthening the fingers and the grasp of the hands,
as in swinging back and forth by the arms, and in
developing certain arm, back, and abdominal muscles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
as in lifting the body so as to touch the chin
to the bar, few exercises are better. The latter was
a favorite exercise of William Cullen Bryant, and
one to which he attached much value. It is attended
with some danger, however, and should not
be attempted without preparatory drill. The sides
of the bar, at the ends where it enters the cleats,
should be slightly flattened, so as not to turn with
the swinging motion of the body. Two or three
sets of cleats may be used, adapting the height to
different members of the family.</p>

<h2 id="REST">REST</h2>


<p><b>Its Necessity.</b>&mdash;Rest is as necessary as exercise.
We cannot be active continually. Repose
must succeed labor. Alfred the Great is credited
with the recommendation that each day be divided
into three parts, eight hours for labor, eight hours
for recreation, and eight hours for sleep.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Change of Employment.</b>&mdash;A change of occupation
affords rest. The wood chopper finds relief
from his ax by using his saw. A different set of
muscles is brought into play. Persons might often
save themselves from excessive fatigue by the adoption
of this principle. When physical labor is made
to alternate with mental activity, the sense of rest
is more apparent.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Sleep.</b>&mdash;The best form of rest is found in sleep.
All voluntary activity then ceases. Even the involuntary
processes of circulation and respiration
seem to share in the general restfulness, for during
sleep their action is more tardy, and, as a result,
the temperature of the body is somewhat lower.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
More covering is needed during sleep than during
the waking hours.</p>

<p>While the body is in action, the process of pulling
down predominates, but during sleep nutrition goes
on, the wasted tissues are built up, and we rise refreshed
and prepared for the new day’s duties.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Amount of Sleep.</b>&mdash;All persons do not require
the same amount of sleep. It is said that Frederick
the Great slept only five hours each night. Napoleon
Bonaparte could pass days with only a few
hours’ rest. Persons whose labors are mental require
more sleep than those who work with their
hands.</p>

<p>The average person in good health requires eight
hours’ sleep. Children, invalids, and the aged need
more. Those who take less should make a careful
study of themselves to ascertain whether they get all
the refreshment of mind and body that they need.
If sleep is insufficient, it will show itself sooner or
later in general lassitude and weakness. The imperative
demands of Nature are shown in the recorded
instances of sailors on war vessels falling
asleep on the gun-deck while their ships were in
action, of soldiers falling asleep on the march, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
even persons falling asleep on the rack in the intervals
of their torture.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Position While Sleeping.</b>&mdash;An active, healthy
child will sleep well in almost any position, but a
nervous, wakeful person, who is obliged night after
night to woo sleep, must study what conditions are
most conducive to its attainment.</p>

<p>Most persons sleep best on the right side. In
this position the stomach is easily emptied, and the
liver does not press upon the heart and stomach.
Those affected with heart trouble will experience
less oppression and distress in this position than by
sleeping on either the back or on the left side.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Pillow.</b>&mdash;A high pillow, especially if firm
and unyielding, cramps the neck and interferes with
respiration and circulation. Some writers upon
health advocate the use of no pillow, but most persons,
either from habit or for more substantial reasons,
find a pillow of moderate size to be of advantage.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>The Mattress.</b>&mdash;The old-time bed-ticking filled
with clean oats straw, thoroughly shaken up each
day, and renewed once or twice a year, made a thoroughly
comfortable and wholesome bed. In these
modern days, hair, cotton, felt, and corn husk are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the substances most commonly employed. A good
mattress is neither too soft nor too hard, but yields
to the exterior bony processes of the body without
engulfing the sleeper. Feathers, once very widely
used, are now generally condemned by physicians
and sanitarians.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Rest During the Day.</b>&mdash;Almost everyone has
experienced the invigorating influence of an after-dinner
nap during the long days of summer. Many
persons would accomplish more work by taking a
rest of ten or fifteen minutes once or twice a day at
all seasons of the year. To women in poor health,
and to those who are overworked, this suggestion
has special application. It not only rests the tired
muscles but it soothes the nerves, and serves as a
most refreshing tonic. Instead of being a loss of
time, it will prove to be time saved. More actual
work, both of hands and brain, will be accomplished,
and with less expenditure of vital force. Dr. William
Pepper accomplished an immense amount of
work with but very little sleep. It was not unusual
for him, when sorely in need of rest, to break off
in the midst of his work, lie down and immediately
go to sleep, and after five or ten minutes wake up
refreshed.</p>

<p><b>Site.</b>&mdash;In the selection of a home, due regard
should be had to the site. High ground is more
healthful than that which is low; a loose, dry, sandy,
or gravelly soil is better than one that is wet and
clayey. Made ground, as a rule, is unhealthful, as
it is usually low to begin with, and is commonly
filled up with earth which contains more or less
organic matter.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Soil.</b>&mdash;The interstices of the soil are occupied
by air, or water, or both. The impurities of the
soil mingle with the ground air, and render it unfit
for breathing. When this ground air is forced
above the surface by an influx of water or by the
pressure of the heavier air above, much danger
lurks in the surface atmosphere. Damp cellars and
basements should be avoided, and the upper rooms
of the house selected for living and sleeping rooms.
Careful scientific investigation has established a
close connection between cholera, typhoid fever,
malarial fevers, and the rise and fall of the water
in the soil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Henry I. Bowditch, of Boston, some years
ago, formulated these two propositions:</p>

<p>First, A residence in or near a damp soil, whether
that dampness be inherent in the soil itself or caused
by percolation from adjacent ponds, rivers, meadows,
or springy soils, is one of the principal causes
of consumption in Massachusetts, probably in New
England, and possibly in other portions of the
globe.</p>

<p>Second, Consumption can be checked in its career,
and possibly&mdash;nay, probably&mdash;prevented in
some instances by attention to this law.</p>

<p>The truth of these propositions was, later, corroborated
by Dr. William Pepper, of Philadelphia,
and by Dr. Buchanan, of England. It is even suspected
by certain physicians that some of the prevalent
diseases among horses and cattle are due to
dampness of the soil.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Drainage of the Soil.</b>&mdash;In view of the above
facts, the importance of draining wet soil is obvious.
A noted scientist states that ground in which the
water is sixteen or more feet below the surface is
uniformly healthy; when it is less than five feet, it
is always unhealthy; and that a fluctuating level,
especially if the changes are sudden, is very unhealthy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Certain trees and plants, such as the
eucalyptus and the sun-flower, whose roots absorb
a prodigious quantity of water which is given off
through the leaves, are useful in drying wet soils.</p>

<p>The close connection between various forms of
disease and the condition of the soil has many times
been pointed out. Some years ago, the British government
instituted an examination of the effects of
drainage in twenty-four towns. While the results
indicate a general diminution of the death-rate, the
deaths from consumption show the greatest reduction.
All forms of malarial disease, fever and
ague, neuralgia, influenza, dysentery and other diseases
of the bowels are also greatly reduced by
draining wet soils.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Duty of the Householder.</b>&mdash;It should be the
first duty of every householder to secure perfect
means for conveying beyond the walls of his domicile
everything of a dangerous character that is
generated within it, and to secure his home against
the entrance of foul air, impure water, or unusual
dampness. While the responsibilities of the dweller
in the city are shared by the city officials, in that the
city supplies the water and provides the sewer to
carry off the waste from the kitchen, lavatory, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
toilet, yet the householder needs to see that absolute
cleanliness is observed, that the pipes are regularly
flushed, and the traps kept in good working order,
that no decomposing substances are permitted to
give off their poisonous gases in cellar, alley, or
yard, and that the cellar and foundation walls are
free from excessive moisture. The dweller in the
country has the additional responsibility of securing
and preserving a pure water supply, and of providing
proper means for the disposal of the waste of
the household.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Dry Cellars.</b>&mdash;The floor of the cellar should be
covered with an impervious concrete. The foundation
walls, especially if built of soft stone, should be
furnished with a course of hydraulic cement or other
impervious material, and the inside surface thoroughly
coated with the same. Where there is a
heater or furnace in the cellar, the evils of dampness
are somewhat reduced during the winter
months while the fires are kept going. If the soil
is wet or springy, a drain of ordinary field tile of
small size should be laid all around the inside of the
cellar walls, and, together with the rest of the cellar
floor, should be covered with concrete.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Kitchen Drains.</b>&mdash;In many country houses this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
is the only drain, and it is often the source of incalculable
mischief, due in most cases to sheer carelessness.
The drain pipe need not be large&mdash;four
inches in diameter is sufficient&mdash;but it must be kept
free of obstruction, so that the waste from the
kitchen may pass off rapidly, and no part of it be
suffered to lodge, to decompose, and to send its
death-distilling gases back to the kitchen, and thence
through the other rooms of the house. Not only
should the outlet of the kitchen drain be kept away
from the well or cistern, but no part of the drain
pipe should come within twenty feet of it. The best
of pipes and joints, unless frequently renewed, are
apt to break, and a very small aperture leading
from the drain pipe into the source of supply of
drinking water may endanger not only the single
household but the entire community. A well of
infected water in London, spoken of as “the Broad
Street pump,” and famous in the annals of epidemics,
is known to have caused the death of over five
hundred people in a single week.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Drinking Water.</b>&mdash;So large an amount of sickness
has been directly traced to an impure water
supply that too much emphasis cannot be placed
upon the need of proper precaution. Not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
should the ground about the top of the well be
banked to throw off surface water, but the upper
wall of the well, for a distance of five or six feet
from the surface of the ground, should be laid in
cement, and the space between the wall and the
ground filled in with wet clay well puddled around
the curbing.</p>

<p>If a gravel seam or loose porous rock lies between
the well and the cess-pool, even when these
are a considerable distance apart, there is absolute
danger, unless the receptacle for the waste products
of the household be made thoroughly water-tight.
Without this precaution, the well may be safe for
a few months or even a year or more, but sooner
or later the foul fecal matter will reach the source
of water supply, carrying with it disease and death.
No odor or taste may mark the inflow of polluted
matter. Some of the most dangerous well-waters
are sparkling in appearance and refreshing to the
taste.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Sewage.</b>&mdash;Few subjects relating to health are of
greater importance than the proper disposal of the
refuse and waste matter of the household. Even
if free from the specific germs of disease, the organic
matters contained in sewage give rise to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
noxious emanations, which, when inhaled, lower the
tone of the system and render it an easy prey to
disease.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Dangers of the Soil Pipe.</b>&mdash;It is chiefly through
the soil pipe that cess-pool and sewer gas finds its
way into the house. The return of these foul
emanations is often caused by the force of their own
expansion and sometimes by the pressure of the
sewer air behind them. The water-traps afford but
a slight barrier to their progress. Every drain pipe
leading to cess-pool or sewer should be connected
with a ventilating shaft which will carry the foul
vapors above the roof of the house, and as far away
from the windows as possible.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer for Edinburgh, in a recent
report, declared that wherever water-closets had
been introduced, in the course of one year there
were double the number of deaths from typhoid and
scarlet-fever, and that any epidemic fever occurring
in these houses assumed a character of malignant
mortality.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Disinfectants.</b>&mdash;Chemical disinfectants are used
by many good housewives, and are helpful, but they
cannot be wholly relied upon. Cleanliness, ventilation,
and dryness are the natural disinfectants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Artificial disinfectants can no more be substituted
for them than perfumes can be made to take the
place of soap and water.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Sewer Gas.</b>&mdash;This poisonous gas is known
chiefly by its effect. It frequently passes the water-traps
and enters our sleeping and living rooms,
there to do its fatal work. The alternate floods
of hot and cold water open the joints of iron pipes,
and allow the gas to escape. Leaden gas pipes decay
and become perforated, with the same result.
Dr. Fergus, in his pamphlet “The Sewage Question,”
says: “For some years I have insisted on a
careful examination of the soil pipes wherever I
have cases of typhoid or diphtheria, and in every
case where I could get this carefully carried out I
have detected perforated pipes, or have found sewer
air getting into the houses in some other way. In
many cases the plumbers have declared pipes to be
all right, which turned out to be very defective when
uncovered.”</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Water-Traps.</b>&mdash;These are not so effective in
preventing the escape of sewer gas as they are considered
to be. Experiments with glass tubes shaped
and arranged just as the ordinary water-traps in
sinks and closets are arranged have shown that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
light gases pass through by the top of the bend, and
the heavy gases by the bottom. A rush of wind up
the mouth of a sewer, or a heavy dash of rain which
fills the sewer and reduces the air space, so increases
the pressure of the gas within the sewer and soil
pipe that the ordinary water-traps are not able to
resist it.</p>

<p>Water-traps that are not used for a time become
death-traps. The water soon evaporates, and affords
an unobstructed channel for the conveyance of
foul gases from cess-pool or sewer to the rooms of
the house. Houses that are vacated for the summer,
and that are without tenants for a time, should be
thoroughly cleaned and ventilated, and have all
pipes and drains flushed with water before being
occupied.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Size, Flow, and Fall of Drain Pipes.</b>&mdash;The efficiency
of a drain or sewer depends upon its capacity,
its slope or incline, and the velocity of its
flow. If the amount of water flowing is proportionate
to the size of the conduit, sewers of different
sizes give the same velocity at different inclinations.
A ten-foot sewer with a fall of two feet per mile,
a five-foot sewer with a fall of four feet per mile, a
two-foot sewer with a fall of ten feet per mile, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
a one-foot sewer with a fall of twenty feet per mile
will have the same velocity provided they are filled
in proportion to their capacity. The ten-foot sewer
will require one hundred times as much sewage as
will the one-foot sewer. If it has less, the velocity
of its stream will be correspondingly diminished. It
is especially important, therefore, that the size of
the conduit be adapted to the volume of the stream,
as well as to the slope or inclination.</p>

<p>An experienced engineer gives a velocity of three
feet per second as the least that should be allowed
for the outlet drain of a house. To secure this flow a
four-inch drain should have a minimum inclination
of one inch in ninety-two; a six-inch drain, one in
one hundred and thirty-seven; a nine-inch drain,
one in two hundred and six; and to attain the above
velocity of three feet per second at these inclinations
they must run not less than half full. The great
purpose of all modern sewage systems is to carry
off all waste matters before they have time to
decompose.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Joints of Drain Pipes.</b>&mdash;These should be made
so smooth within as not to impede the flow of
sewage, nor become obstructed by catching thread,
strings, hair, and other floating substances. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
should be so tight as absolutely to prevent any leakage
of either fluid or gaseous matter, and render impossible
the entrance of the small filaments of the
roots of trees growing along their course. They
should be supported on solid pillars of brick or stone,
and not spiked to cellar walls where a slight settling
will force the joints and cause a leak. They should
be so firmly supported at every point that after the
joints have been cemented no possible change of
direction or slope of pipe can occur. Any such
change is sure to work disaster.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Sewer Ventilation.</b>&mdash;No sewer is safe that does
not have a free current of air passing through it.
Motion and aeration are the safeguards against infection.
Sewers should be constructed so as to
secure a constant flow, with no sharp angles or short
turns to impede its progress, and with frequent
vents leading to the surface of the street. Thus
diluted, the sewer gas becomes harmless, the pressure
in the conduits is relieved, and the danger of
the gas forcing its way through the water-traps into
the living and sleeping rooms of our homes is
avoided.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Location of Closet.</b>&mdash;The water closet should
be so placed as to have an exterior window, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
means of which it may be fully ventilated. Under
no circumstances should the closet open directly into
the bedroom. When entered from the hallway or
landing, the conditions may be improved by cutting
off half of the space as a vestibule or outer apartment,
thus preventing any foul odors from reaching
the sleeping rooms. For reasons of convenience as
well as of health the bath-room and lavatory should
be separate from the water closet.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Disposal of Garbage.</b>&mdash;In cities, the public authorities
collect and dispose of the solid waste of
the kitchen. In the country, and wherever chickens,
cows, or pigs are kept, these waste substances may
be utilized. Some private families burn them.
Where this cannot be done they should be removed
from the dwelling far enough to prevent their decomposition
from giving rise to any unpleasant or
unwholesome odors. No compost heap should be
maintained within one hundred yards of a dwelling.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Dry Earth Closet.</b>&mdash;This system of disposing
of the waste matter of the household is not so well
known in the United States as it is in England,
where it has been in successful use for many years.
The best apparatus is that invented by Rev. Henry
Moule, an English clergyman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>The following claims are made for it, and they
are supported by the best authorities:</p>

<p>1. It furnishes a comfortable closet on any floor
of the house, and it may be supplied with earth and
cleaned of its deposits by the servants without the
intervention or knowledge of any member of the
household.</p>

<p>2. It furnishes a portable commode in any
dressing-room, bedroom, or closet, the care of
which is no more disagreeable than that of an ordinary
fireplace.</p>

<p>3. It affords appliances for the use of immovable
invalids which entirely remove the distressing accompaniments
of their care.</p>

<p>4. It provides for the complete and effectual
removal of all liquid waste of sleeping-rooms and
kitchen.</p>

<p>5. It completely suppresses the odors which, despite
the comfort and elegance of modern living,
still hang about cesspools and privy-vaults, and
attend the removal of their contents.</p>

<p>The expense is trifling as compared with that of
water sewerage. The care and attention needed is
somewhat greater, and this probably accounts for
the limited use of the system in this country. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
country houses, and in small towns and villages
where the facilities of a system of public sewerage
are not to be had, it would seem that the advantages
of the earth-closet system would commend it to
general favor.</p>

<p>The earth-closet is a mechanical contrivance attached
to the ordinary seat, for measuring out and
discharging into the vault or pan below a sufficient
quantity of sifted dry earth to entirely cover the
solid ordure and to absorb the urine. The earth is
discharged by an ordinary chain or wire-pull, similar
to that used in the water-closet. The vault or
pan beneath the seat is so arranged that the accumulation
may be readily removed. In a small family
once in two or three weeks is often enough to empty
the pan or drawer unless it is small. The entire
apparatus need not cover more than two feet square
by three feet high.</p>

<p>It is estimated that our present wasteful method
of disposing of the night-soil occasions an annual
money loss to the country of over $100,000,000.
When the economic value of human excreta becomes
as well known in the United States as it is in China
and Japan we will cease to cast it into the sea.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>A Truthful Picture.</b>&mdash;Any one who has lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
among or mingled much with people in the country
and in hamlets and villages will recognize the truthfulness
of the following picture as presented by
George E. Waring, Jr., in “How to Drain a House.”
He says:</p>

<p>“Let us see what chance a woman living in the
country has to escape the direst evils that &#8216;delicate
health’ has in store for its victims. The privy
stands perhaps at the bottom of the garden, fifty
yards from the house, approached by a walk bordered
by long grass, which is always wet except
during the sunny part of the day, overhung by
shrubbery and vines, which are often dripping with
wet. In winter, snow-drifts block the way, and during
rain there is no shelter from any side. The
house itself is fearfully cold, if not drifted half-full
with snow or flooded with rain.</p>

<p>“A woman who is comfortably housed during
stormy weather will, if it is possible, postpone for
days together the dreadful necessity for exposure
that such conditions imply. If the walk is exposed
to a neighboring workshop window, the visit will
probably be put off until dark. In either case, no
amount of reasoning will convince a woman that it
is her duty, for the sake of preventing troubles of
which she is yet ignorant, to expose herself to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
danger, the discomfort, and the annoyance that regularity
under such circumstances implies.</p>

<p>“I pass over now the barbarous foulness and the
stifling odor of the privy-vault. It is only as an
unavoidable evil that these have been tolerated;
but I cannot too strongly urge attention to the point
taken above, and insist on the fact that every consideration
of humanity, and of the welfare not only
of your own families, but of the whole community,
demands a speedy reform of this abuse. * * *
I make no apology for calling the attention of women
themselves to this important matter, believing that
they will universally concede that, however much
of elegance and comfort may surround them in the
appointments of their homes, their mode of life is
neither decent, civilized, nor safe, unless they are
provided with the conveniences that the water-closet
and the earth-closet alone make possible.”</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Woman’s Part in Sanitation.</b>&mdash;Some years ago,
Dr. B. W. Richardson, then president of the British
Medical Association, said: “I want strongly to
enforce that it is the women on whom full sanitary
light requires to fall. Health in the home is health
everywhere; elsewhere it has no abiding place. I
have been brought indeed by experience to the conclusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
that the whole future progress of the sanitary
movement rests for permanent and executive
support on the women of the country. When, as a
physician, I enter a house where there is a contagious
disease, I am, of course, primarily impressed
by the type of the disease, and the age,
strength, and condition of the sick person. From
the observations made on these points, I form a
judgment of the possible course and termination of
the disease; and, at one time, I should have thought
such observations sufficient. A glance at the appointments
and arrangements and management of
the house is now necessary to make perfect the
judgment. The men of the house come and go;
know little of the ins and outs of anything domestic;
are guided by what they are told; and are practically
of no assistance whatever. The women are conversant
with every nook of the dwelling, from basement
to roof; and on their knowledge, wisdom, and
skill, the physician rests his hopes.”</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Materials of the Dwelling.</b>&mdash;No material is so
dry and healthful as wood. Where the dangers of
fire preclude the use of this material, as in close and
compact cities and towns, and where brick and
stone must be employed, such houses may, with very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
slight additional expense, be rendered comparatively
dry. Ordinary bricks absorb a great deal of moisture,
and carry dampness from cellar to attic. Soft
building stone is nearly as bad. The use of a double
course of vitrified brick on a thick layer of the best
cement just above the foundation wall, or ground
line, will prevent the dampness of the soil from
being carried up through the walls. The outside
dampness from rains and sleet may also be corrected
by the use of thick studding against the walls
on the inside to support the plastering. This leaves
an inch or two of space between the outer wall and
the plastering, through which the air can circulate,
and thus preserve the inner walls of the dwelling
from dampness.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Lighting.</b>&mdash;The Italians have a proverb, “When
you let the sunshine in you drive the doctor out.”
A house should be constructed so as to admit an
abundance of light. Architects, and builders, too,
often undervalue the health-giving properties of
sunshine, or sacrifice them to other considerations.
Even the mistress of the house, whose first thought
should be the health of herself and that of her
children, frequently shuts out the sunshine to save
her carpets and furniture. It is better to have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
roses on the children’s cheeks than on the carpets.</p>

<p>Trees should not be planted so close to a house
as to obstruct the free ingress of light and air. If
the walls are damp, the tree’s shade will help to preserve
the dampness. Numerous instances are recorded
of the deaths of persons clearly traced to the
damp walls, moss-covered roofs, and general unhealthfulness
arising from the close proximity of
dense trees which overhung the dwelling and shut
out the sunlight. When the sad truth was at last
discovered, and the trees were removed, the houses
which, before, were seldom free from sickness and
sorrow, became wholesome and cheerful.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Warming.</b>&mdash;The subjects of warmth and ventilation
are so closely related that they will necessarily
overlap in their treatment. In point of importance
probably no two subjects have a larger
bearing upon health. No scheme has yet been devised
by which satisfactory means of heating and
ventilation are combined with money-saving. For
purposes of ventilation, the old-time open hearth was
without a rival. But while the faces of our grandparents
were roasted, successive chills chased up
their backs. In these days of scarcity of fuel, the
open hearth is the rich man’s luxury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Most houses throughout the country are still
warmed by stoves. In cities and towns, dwelling
houses are generally warmed by the hot-air furnaces,
while many of the larger establishments&mdash;stores,
offices, hotels, banks, apartment houses&mdash;are supplied
with steam heat.</p>

<p>An important consideration in all cases of hot-air
heating is that the air be taken from the outside
through a conduit instead of using the air from the
cellar, as is too frequently done. In some cities and
suburban towns, pure air is brought into the cellar
through a conduit where it passes through a box
in which it is heated by steam pipes, the steam being
brought from a central plant which supplies several
hundred houses. The air when heated passes
through flues to the several rooms of the dwelling,
and is turned on and off by registers in the usual
way. This system avoids all dirt of coal and ashes,
and all care of fires, and is much to be commended.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Uniform Temperature.</b>&mdash;In all schemes for the
warming of houses, it is important to keep the entire
building at a uniform, comfortable temperature. In
dwellings, the halls and living rooms should be so
evenly warmed that no sensation of chilliness is felt
in passing from one room into another. This, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
itself, costs much fuel, and when there is added the
further cost of heating the fresh air which is necessary
to supply the place of that which has become
vitiated by use, the truth of the proposition that
suitable heating and ventilation are costly becomes
apparent.</p>

<p>Those who live in warm, close, ill-ventilated
rooms are much more subject to colds from exposure
to draughts and cold air than those who
dwell in a pure atmosphere of moderate temperature.
This being the case, persons should not accustom
themselves to a higher temperature than is
barely necessary for comfort. Some persons are
most comfortable with a room temperature in winter
of 68º or 69º Fahrenheit. Others require a
temperature of 70º or 71º. Invalids, infants, and
old persons, whose vitality is low, require a higher
temperature than those in the full vigor of life.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Ventilation.</b>&mdash;The importance of breathing
pure air was fully discussed in a previous chapter.
The best methods of securing it will be considered
here.</p>

<p>Air, when heated, becomes lighter and rises.
Cool air, when it enters a warm room, sinks to the
bottom. The cooler and purer air of a room is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
therefore, always found nearest the floor. Although
the carbonic acid given out by the lungs is heavier
than an equal quantity of atmospheric air, yet, by the
operation of the law of diffusion, it commingles
with the other gases, and is found in greatest
quantity near the ceiling. Doors and windows are
the means commonly employed for ventilation;
transoms and special ventilating flues are used to
some extent.</p>

<p>Where large numbers of people are congregated
together for several hours at a time, as in churches,
theatres, and public halls, proper ventilation becomes
a matter of extreme importance. If, in such cases,
doors and windows alone are depended upon, the
results are never satisfactory. Those nearest the
windows are made uncomfortable by the chilling
drafts, while the persons in the middle of the room
experience very little relief from the stifling atmosphere.
In the construction of such buildings suitable
provision should be made in floor, side-wall, and
ceiling for an ample supply of pure air, without a
conscious current or other annoyance to the audience.
In school houses, where children are confined
for long periods, and where their physical
growth and mental activity demand the purest air,
neglect of proper means of ventilation on the part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
of school directors and trustees is little short of
criminal.</p>

<p>In the home the subject of ventilation during the
day time is a simple matter. The frequent opening
of outer doors and of inner doors, with the occasional
lowering of the upper sash of the window,
will furnish an abundant supply of pure air.</p>

<p>The ventilation of the sleeping room is not always
so simple, especially where privacy demands the
bolting of the chamber door. The diminished vitality
of the individual during sleep requires that
there shall be no draft over his bed. If there be but
a single window, place the bed so as to escape the
draft. Lower the upper sash about two inches.
If there be two sleepers in the room lower it three
inches. Raise the lower sash an inch or two. This
gives three air spaces, top, bottom, and in the middle
where the two sashes overlap. A thin board
placed on edge in the window ledge, and fitting inside
the window strip, will throw the current of air
upward, and when the wind is strong, will prevent
a draft. A transom over the door stimulates a
gentle current of air, and is of great advantage. In
some families, where privacy permits, the door is
left slightly ajar at night. This, with a slight opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
of an outer window, will secure ample ventilation.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Air Currents.</b>&mdash;A current of two feet per second
is scarcely perceptible; of three feet is quite noticeable;
of five feet is a positive draft. In introducing
fresh air into a room the current should nowhere
exceed two feet per second at the point of
entrance.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Individual Requirements of Air.</b>&mdash;Each adult
person requires three thousand cubic feet of air per
hour. This will demand an opening or place of entrance
equal to twenty-four square inches, and an
equal amount of space for the foul air to escape. An
opening four by six inches will give much more air
than one twelve by two inches by reason of the
smaller friction upon the sides. Ventilation through
a single pipe or aperture is more effective than that
through several apertures of equal aggregate area.</p>


<p class="mt2"><b>Stairs.</b>&mdash;Many persons, especially women, who,
as a rule, do more stair climbing than men, find it
very exhausting. Some stairs are easier to mount
than others. In the construction of stairways, architects
and builders should reduce the labor to the
minimum. The wants of a certain invalid necessitated
a constant going up and down stairs. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
successive nurses were wont to remark, “I never
saw, before, such an easy flight of stairs.” The
exact measurements of this stairway are: seven
and one-eighth inches rise; eleven and one-half
inches depth, or space from the front edge to the
back part of each step. There is a landing near the
middle. A landing gives the climber an opportunity
to get a full breath, and greatly reduces the
effort of mounting.</p>

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
